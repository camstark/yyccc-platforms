Keep tax increase at or below inflation. I pledge that I will not increase property taxes greater than inflation.</p><p>2.	No more taking the tax room. I will never vote in favour of taking the provinces’ tax space.</p><p>3.	No new taxes. Regardless of what authority the new city charter gives the Mayor, I will not support any new fee or tax.</p><p>Changing the way we tax small businesses:</p><p>We used to rely on big companies, especially the oil and gas sector to shoulder a large part of our nonresidential property tax. With the economic downturn, that revenue can no longer be relied upon, pushing more of the non‐residential tax burden to small business.</p><p>We need to: Create specific categories for different types of businesses (ie. restaurants, small and large businesses) to minimize the shift in taxes from one sector to another.</p><p>What this means to small business owners is that during tough economic times their incremental tax burden would be lessened regardless of what occurs in non‐residential sectors. They would not see a huge increase year over year which they are currently experiencing.</p><p>SPENDING:</p><p>I have been recognized as a fiscally responsible and detail oriented member of Council. I am proud of my record, I always show up with ideas on how to trim back and be more efficient.</p><p>Municipal governments are challenged in delivering services to their residents due to the limited options to raise revenue. The bulk of the City’s revenue is raised through property tax, user fees and investment income. Sixty per cent of that revenue is spent on the City’s operating costs for salaries.</p><p>•	I will call for restraint in future union salary increase to reflect our current economic reality and work towards achieving greater parity between private and public sector agreements.</p><p>•	I will balance needs for service while being fiscally responsible.</p><p>•	I commit to hiring subject matter experts in different fields, within the Mayor’s budget, to assess the efficiency of city departments to bring forward recommendations to improve the operational efficiency of The City.</p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE:</p><p>Council’s focus needs to be on building what we can afford, but also planning for the future. Major infrastructure projects like the Green Line are a great idea, but we don’t have the money to do it all at once.</p><p>With new technology like autonomous vehicles hitting the market in the near future, we need to reassess our priorities to ensure that we can move people as efficiently as possible. We need to focus on improving existing infrastructure to respond to the increasing demand for private transportation, instead of focusing the priority solely on public transportation.</p><p>As Mayor, I will continue to advocate for investments in public transportation and reprioritize the upgrades to current infrastructure and intersections to ease traffic congestion.</p>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Twm0klpK8,"<p>Andre Chabot has been working to make his community better for his entire adult life and has called Calgary home since 1971, when his family moved here from Saskatchewan.</p><p>Prior to being elected as Councillor for Ward 10 in 2005, Andre operated, managed and owned electronic parts distribution businesses for over 18 years.

We need to control reckless spending, make streets safer and rein in excessive tax increases. These are the challenges the next council will face.  It will take a strong, creative, thoughtful leader to succeed. I am that leader. It’s time for a change. Calgary, we need a new Mayor.”</p><p>STRONG COLLABORATIVE LEADERSHIP</p><p>Respect begins at the top. I will work to create a team-focused environment at City Hall. A culture that establishes clear and meaningful priorities which has genuine respect for the community feedback process.</p><p>And the city must keep its word. We will not abandon the residents of Midfield Park. The city promised them an alternative location. That is what they shall have.</p><p>An efficient city council needs to encourage the economy, not interfere with business. City bureaucracy and red tape needs to make way for responsible leadership to foster a strong economy.</p><p>I will streamline regulations to guarantee response time for development applications. It takes too long for projects to get approved. We need to attract businesses to Calgary.</p><p>That is what an efficient city council can do to encourage the economy.</p><p>LOWER TAXES / COST CONTROL</p><p>Effective leadership has been absent at City Hall. Council operations have degenerated to a point where new positions have been created that provide no direct value to Calgarians.  For example, the first ethics advisor and an integrity commissioner were hired in 2016 because council was unable to govern itself in a professional, ethical manner. A 2017 City Clerks’ report even proposed to pay $170 thousand dollars a year for someone to run their meetings, which makes no sense.</p><p>This demonstrates zero comprehension of Calgary’s economic reality. Our city is in the third year of a recession. Tens of thousands have lost their jobs and many more have had their salaries slashed.</p><p>City Hall’s response is a 51% tax hike for residents and 70% tax hike for business.</p><p>The City needs to cut unnecessary spending, rein in rampant tax increases, streamline operations, maximize efficiencies and stop paying millions of dollars to consultants for more studies.</p><p>It’s time for a common sense approach.</p><p>SAFE AND VIBRANT COMMUNITIES</p><p>I have the greatest respect for the first responders that serve our city. These are the brave men and women who risk their lives on a daily basis to make our community safe for the rest of us.</p><p>In recent years we’ve seen crime dramatically increase on our streets, in our homes and on our public transit system. The recent city budget called for hiring 15 new people. Were they police officers?  No, they were communications bureaucrats.</p><p>Everyone has a role to play in making our city safe, but it starts with the Mayor and City Council. We must ensure that there are adequate and efficiently deployed resources for Police and Fire</p><p>Your hard earned taxpayer dollars should be spent prudently and where needs are greatest.</p>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N6E7lAh-iU,"<p>Bill Smith and his wife Mary are born and raised Calgarians with four grown children.

Saying that, I will be fulfilling my mayoralty obligations and doing what is Best for the city of Calgary at home and abroad.</p><p>I will not be doing any shady deals to handicap or hinder  company for benefit of a certain one. I call a spade a spade and if I’m asked, I’ll answer the question to the best of my knowledge, most likely do some more research on that and on other matters also.  I will lead by example and I’m asking the citizens of this city to call their alderperson if there is something that they don’t like in their neighborhood. I’d like them to document the date, time, and who they spoke to even if it was an answering machine. If they don’t get a call back from that alderperson in a week, call me on the eighth day so I can round up some city employees in that particular division and have it dealt with. I wouldn’t be surprised if I’m out on the job helping get it completed. Team work gets it done Faster and Better.</p><p>I want the politicians to work for their money instead of bankrolling the public. When I get 2000 phoned in complaints from the citizens of this city I’ll be asking those citizens to fax me the documents that they wrote up on the date, time, who they spoke to, and if that problem was dealt with and by whom  in a timely fashion. I’ll be inviting said citizens who had complaints and to city hall so they can voice their neglect to said alderpersons. If certain alderpersons aren’t doing their job that they’re being paid for to tell them there Fired! I want all of city council, including myself to be held accountable to the citizens of this city. I personally would like to abolish the pension plan for alderpersons and the Mayor. They can collect old age pension when they get that age if anything is left. If they can’t live off the wage that they’re getting then they shouldn’t be where there at!  I’d like to bring the wages back to reality and if alderpersons or other mayoralty candidates want to keep fleecing the citizens of this city on how much their worth, that means they’re not worth it!</p><p>I am Best Value as a person that’s running for Mayor and the Best person to give this city’s citizens the</p><p>Best Bang for their Buck!!</p><p>Thank you,</p><p>Brent Chisholm</p><p>For the next term as your Mayor.</p>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fpd3PvSpr4,"<p>Hello my name is Brent Chisholm, I am 53, originally from Brooks, Alberta but I have been a resident of Calgary for the last 30 years,  I grew up helping my uncle on his farm, then I started swamping hauling drilling mud to the drilling rigs and mixing a drilling fluid for another company while attending school.  I have done quite a few different oil field jobs in my career.  I have driven people around and heard interesting stories in my limousine company from the Rich and Famous and the Poor and Down trodden.   I like to make people Happy and them knowing that they got their moneys worth dealing with me.  I am in the running to become the Best investment that the City of Calgary has ever made in a Mayor for this city.  I will go to areas set by citizens of the city to Truthfully answer their questions in their communities.  Also the citizens of Calgary  will be able to call my office line and get answers and a call back from me.  I will listen to the people in all areas of the city and because they know what is needed.  I will be taking a Big and Busy part of getting the city finances and personnel in working order.  I am going to need citizens to enlighten me in all areas to Better this Fine City.</p><p>Thank you</p><p>Brent Chisholm</p>",,,,,,403-805-5466,SirChisholm@gmail.com,

To remember it’s your money, not mine.</p><p>•	Initiate a full forensic audit of all the city’s dealings – operating budgets AND capital budgets</p><p>•	Restrain spurious City Hall expenditures through getting back to basic services in the city</p><p>•	Initiate a long and lasting tax cut to businesses and residents in this city</p><p>2.	To keep your family safe.</p><p>•	Bring law and order back to the streets of Calgary</p><p>•	Bring community policing back with beat cops and quality community liaisons</p><p>•	Reenergize policing by continuing to build bridges between Alberta Health Services, the Police, homeless agencies, families, churches, schools and community representatives with a collaborative approach</p><p>3.	To keep Calgary’s neighbourhoods and Community Associations as the focal point of decision making.</p><p>•	Rebirth our whole citywide model of Community Associations, working to enshrine certain legislative powers at the neighbourhood level</p><p>•	Directly support families as the key building block of our city</p><p>•	Facilitate the development of before and after school care initiatives at key neighbourhood focal points</p><p>Calgary’s economy is in a tailspin. Our unemployment is at a record high and there are vast amounts of people living in poverty. This is not the same city that it used to be. Calgary is at a crossroads and Calgarians should consider their choice very carefully when they take to the polls. This is a generational election. The issues being debated today will affect this city for decades.</p><p>Calgarians know that City Hall’s spending priorities are heading in exactly the wrong direction. Instead of funding basic services like transit, police, fire, roads and the like, City Hall has gone on a spacewalk experimenting with social engineering, income redistribution and vanity projects. The Blue Ring and Bowfort Towers characterize the train wreck of City Hall malpractice, which proves how out of touch they are with the average Calgarian.</p><p>As many Calgarians know, the violent crime rate in Calgary has risen in a more aggressive fashion then in any other major Canadian city. A Lapp administration would be unequivocal on tough-on-crime measures. A more affective police funding model needs to be adopted and more dynamic relationships need to be built between police and community stakeholders. The best approach to fighting crime is two pronged: 1) Fund more beat patrols, and 2) Stimulate a sense of belonging in our neighbourhoods. City Hall should be facilitating strong initiatives for families in our communities, such as before and after school programs, daycare and nutritional programs for children. It also goes without saying that the police and neighbourhoods should be working together to confront the opioid crisis head on.  Calgary needs a police force that enforces laws, prevents crime trends and stimulates life in every corner of our society.</p>",,"<p>I was born in this town in March of 1984, the 4th in a family of six kids. I grew up in the Northeast community of Rundle, and both of my parents are professional classical musicians. As a boy, delivering the Calgary Herald to neighbours was part of the morning routine. Growing up, I attended public, private, charter, online, and home schools.  I've worked just about any job in Calgary that you can think of.</p><p>Volunteering and community initiatives have always been a part of my DNA. From helping with ESL and GED courses to assisting with children's reading programs; from volunteering at church summer camps to helping serve meals to Calgary's underprivileged, there has always been something that needed doing.  I've served at community resource centers and on neighbourhood Community Association boards.  In 2010 I ran for Alderman in Ward 10, and I have long been involved in the public discourse.  I've never shied away from answering the call, from serving my neighbourhood or my city.</p><p>I currently work at a homeless shelter downtown, working with people that have mental health struggles and those grappling with addictions.   I have extensive experience helping seniors, indigenous populations, military veterans, the unemployed, disenfranchised, and the vulnerable.  My experiences and my background uniquely prepare me to serve the pressing needs of this city.</p><p>My name is David Lapp and I look forward to serving you as Mayor of Calgary!</p>",https://www.facebook.com/DavidLappForMayor/,,,https://twitter.com/davidlapp4mayor,,403-991-2481,lappteam2017@gmail.com,http://www.lappteam2017.com/

Even in difficult economic times, even where global forces of division seem to be winning, Calgary remains one of the best places in the world to live: The Economist calls us one of the five best cities to live in the entire world.</p><p>The last seven years, we’ve seen tremendous change in Calgary. We’ve invested more in infrastructure than ever before in our city – improving our road networks, building social infrastructure like recreation centres and libraries, and strengthening public transit. Our city is better planned and we’re in excellent financial shape, with the lowest taxes of any major city in Canada and a stellar credit rating.</p><p>But we must keep moving forward. This is not the time to retrench; it’s not the time to give in to smaller dreams nor the time to give up. My platform centers around three distinct themes.</p><p>Better Economy - We are in the midst of a fragile economic recovery, which must be sustained. Too many of our neighbours continue to feel the pain of unemployment and uncertainty about the future. We have to work in three areas: Selling Calgary means promoting our city to businesses, investors and skilled workers around the globe. We also need to create centres of excellence and growth in new industries where we have strength but need to grow to become a major global player. We need to aggressively secure funding from other orders of government to help build infrastructure we need to strengthen our economy and improve our communities, like the Green Line LRT, which will be the largest public works project in Alberta’s history, while ensuring all projects are completed on time and on budget. Finally, promoting entrepreneurship and innovation; helping Calgarians reach their potential, selling our expertise globally and making it even easier to start a business. This means cutting even more red tape, helping City Hall be a partner in business success.</p><p>Stronger and Safer Communities - Every neighbourhood in Calgary must be safe, and every person must have the chance to succeed. This means a new focus on safety, housing, addiction, poverty and the environment. It also means investing in community infrastructure like libraries, rec centres and firehalls, ensuring we build the flood mitigation we need, and promoting and protecting our diversity every single day.</p><p>Smarter City Hall – Using our citizen-centric approach, we’ve found over $325 million in efficiencies and kept Calgary’s taxes the lowest of any big city in Canada. But we need to do more: finding efficiencies, reforming the assessment and appeals process, making it easier to do business with the City, and using the City Charter to get even better.</p><p>There’s a choice this election: turtle and hope the economic downturn passes, or boldly keep moving forward. That choice is clear.</p>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMR3d7o6zjA,"<p>Since being elected mayor in 2010, Naheed Nenshi has worked hard to steer Calgary through periods of unprecedented growth and economic downturn, champion major projects, build better communities, and create a smarter and more citizen-focused City Hall.</p><p>Prior to being elected, Naheed was with McKinsey &amp; Company, later forming his own consulting business to help organizations grow and prosper.

I am devoted to open dialogue, and sensible coherent policies based on a common sense approach that understands, listens, and values constituents. I will be your voice to ensure:</p><p>1: Accountability &amp; Prioritization</p><p>I will ensure Council identifies and organizes it’s priorities.</p><p>The Current Council tries to defer responsibility by delegating vital decisions to unaccountable committees. They refuse to make decisions and pour money into unending studies to avoid accountability.</p><p>In tough economic times, tough decisions need to be made.</p><p>Unfortunately, we can’t have it all. I will make certain that Council’s first focus is on necessities, and only then moves forward with other reasonable projects. I will keep constituents informed of what is impacting their communities, ensuring Calgarians know the decisions I make and the reasons behind them.</p><p>2: Fiscal Responsibility:</p><p>Council must learn to “live within its means”. Taxpayers are not a bottomless source of funds. I am dedicated to identifying which projects are necessary, viable, and will have the greatest return on investment. I will uphold the responsibility of ensuring that every dollar is used wisely, doing away with frivolous spending. I will not forget that every tax dollar comes from the homes of hard working Calgarians.</p><p>3: Decency &amp; Decorum</p><p>Calgarians deserve a City Council they can be proud of. A Council that acts on behalf of Calgarians, rather than themselves. I will stand against petty rivalries, rude behavior, and the embarrassing antics that are often displayed within out current Council. As your representative, my duty is to ensure your voice is heard and your concerns are fairly addressed. It’s time to change the unprofessional behavior that has become the daily norm at City Hall.</p><p>4: Sensible Transit Infrastructure</p><p>Calgary needs coherent infrastructure policies, that ensures affordable and effective transportation for all Calgarians. We need to make it cheap and easy to jump on city transit, and for Calgarians to be able to travel by road quickly and safely.</p><p>5: Safe Livable Communities</p><p>Council must focus on common sense ways to ensure our communities are safe and livable. Front-line community-based policing is vital for the healthy growth of our city. Communities need safe roads, adequate green spaces, recreation opportunities, and accessible amenities –such as markets and libraries– to keep our communities vibrant places we want to live.</p>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQBTtH37HY,"<p>Chris has deep roots in Ward 1 &amp; devotes much of his free time to building and engaging our community.

The upcoming election is the foundation of this engagement but I believe the public deserves to be engaged on a regular basis. The council votes on issues constantly and councillors that maintain a close ear to the ground will be best positioned to best represent their Ward. I’ll use methods like regularly engaging community centres and organizations or improving public access to the council Integrity Commission. I will bring the issues that matter to you, to City Hall. I will be “walking this talk” during both the campaign, and throughout my tenure as councillor.</p><p>ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION</p><p>I believe that economic diversification is the key to our future here in Calgary, and that starts at the ground level. More independent businesses are being started by our neighbours than ever before and North America is progressively looking to Calgary as an environment to invest. We see unprecedented local growth in areas like Tech and Manufacturing. A supportive municipal government is integral to maintaining this pace. As Councillor, I'll ensure the City of Calgary supports the local economy with local sourcing, something it does not currently prioritize.</p><p>COLLEGIALITY</p><p>I see team work amongst colleagues in City Council as the most important element in the success of their initiatives. The decisions and programs councillors spend their time on have lasting impacts on the day to day lives of Calgarians. From cumbersome secondary suite controls to seniors centres, or from expensive olympic bids to strained police budgets, efficiencies begin within our council chambers. Each Ward deserves a thoughtful and collegial representative as they bring their unique perspectives forth on issues affecting Calgary as a whole. When Calgary is run by a team, it can more quickly and effectively address issues. This starts with creating a positive environment for Ward 1 communities, and making sure your needs are addressed.</p>",,"<p>I love Calgary and have lived in Ward 1 and the Northwest for almost two decades. I've been lucky enough to be part of Calgary’s growth throughout my career.</p><p>My early work in community and regional planning allowed me to witness Calgary responding to growth and change. I now have the privilege of watching first hand as Calgary's tech industry grows into an economic powerhouse. I work in the City’s thriving tech industry, providing business development for a local startup. Business is the crux of a strong economy, and I'm a strong believer in entrepreneurship and local economic development. Calgary has a bright future ahead, and the City must play its part.</p><p>I have tremendous respect for Calgarians. I have volunteered side by side with people generously giving their time, at the U of C while completing my BSc and MSc in engineering, in athletics, and for social causes. My work in public engagement has introduced me to smart people and innovative ideas throughout the city. These should be heard, and brought to fruition. As a public engagement specialist, I have the skills and experience make sure that happens.</p><p>Your elected representative is in a position of trust and responsibility that must be honoured with humility and gravity. I intend to fill the office with respect, diligence, and intelligence. I ask for your vote on October 16th, to represent your interests in City Hall, and serve as your Councillor -- to build a strong future for Calgary.</p>",https://www.facebook.com/votecoral,https://www.instagram.com/votecoral/,,https://twitter.com/votecoral,,403-880-1617,coral@votecoral.ca,https://votecoral.ca/

Ward prides himself in working closely with all communities in Ward 1 to ensure he understands their issues and can advocate for them most effectively.</p><p>Lowering taxes, traffic safety, community infrastructure, and seamless school drop-offs and pick-ups are all key issues. Ward focuses on four key values and applies this thinking to all community problems that he works to solve: Accountable Leadership, Common Sense, Lowering Taxes, and being Community Driven.</p><p>Accountable Leadership</p><p>Accountability and Leadership are two of Ward’s personal “musts” to consistently achieve positive results. Ward’s skills and experience have enabled him to “get into the weeds” of financial reporting, and has resulted in his leadership around the City’s move to zero-base budget reviews; this has resulted in significant savings for the tax payer.</p><p>Common Sense</p><p>Common sense seems obvious, but it takes a true leader and community advocate to step back and advocate for practical policies that work for Calgary’s modern families. As the father of two girls, a husband, and a son Ward understands the commitments the average Calgarian has to juggle to ensure their families are provided for, safe, and have all the opportunities to succeed.</p><p>Lowering Taxes</p><p>Ward has been a strong advocate for lowering taxes and unnecessary burdens on all Calgarians. Fiscal prudence starts with the individual and Ward is committed to continuing to be a strong voice for ensuring more of your hard-earned dollars stay in your pocket - where they belong.</p><p>Community Driven</p><p>Crime reduction, increased traffic safety and calmness measures, upgraded infrastructure, access in times of emergency, and advocating for individual communities at the provincial level are all ways Ward has shown he is passionate about representing each community. As a past president of his local community association he has become a skilled advocate for community issues. His commitment to supporting the communities and residents of Ward 1 has never wavered; he has attended 1,046 (and counting) community events and meetings during his first term as Councillor.</p><p>Ward’s approach has been successful during his first term as Ward 1 Councillor. His passion, dedication, and hard work have led to several achievements, including:</p><p>o	Upgraded roads, sidewalks, community buildings, pathways and parks</p><p>o	Traffic calming measures, improved access, and increased safety on our Ward 1 roads</p><p>o	Recreational facilities including the Bowness Park splash park, Silver Springs outdoor pool, Shouldice Athletic Park, and the Shane Homes rec centre</p><p>Ward 1 residents need a representative that will continue to advocate for their best interests. There are many projects on the go and Ward has the experience, leadership, and results-based attitude to ensure projects are completed and constituents’ voices are heard.</p>",,"<p>Ward has lived in Calgary for over 50 years, and has resided with his wife, two daughters and dogs in Ward 1 for over 20 years. Prior to being elected, he engaged with Ward 1 through sports as a coach, business as a senior manager, and community as the past president of the Rocky Ridge Royal Oak Community Association.</p><p>Ward brings to City Council a fiscally accountable approach to spending.  As Vice Chair of Priorities and Finance, his main areas of focus include the financial management of the City and reducing property taxes.  He has driven the improved process of zero base department budget reviews to include the pure cost of delivering services.  As a strong believer in accountability, he communicates to constituents with monthly detailed newsletters and a yearly report of outcomes.</p><p>Before becoming a Councillor, Ward was an advocate for an urban drilling policy, innovative seniors’ programs, traffic calming measures and preservation of wetlands and parks. He worked as a senior leader at Sony, Tim Horton’s, McDonald’s and Hartco Corporation and received several awards for excelling in the business sector, where he had a consistently positive record in the management of multi‐million‐dollar financial budgets.</p><p>As the current Councillor for Ward 1, Ward has attended over 1,000 community events, answered over 50,000 emails from constituents, attended almost 150 council meetings, and been a part of almost 1,250 committee and community meetings.</p>",https://www.facebook.com/Ward4Ward1/,,,https://twitter.com/ward4ward1,,403-585-0465,info@wardsutherland.com,http://www.wardsutherland.com/

More and more over the years we are seeing a very entitled Council where instead of listening and working for our wishes and our needs they are telling us what as Calgarians WE NEED.   I believe a councilor should put forward ideas but they need to be based from the community and citizen input, wishes and desires.    I want to bring a return to true grassroots politics where YOU the citizens of Calgary are in control, not a  council of entitled people nor the administration that has been running city hall for years.</p><p>I will state a few of my key platforms here today.</p><p>-Recall, we need the ability to recall and fire our elected officials if they no longer represent our wishes.   There should not be a free 4 year pass to do whatever you wish.   In the private sector if your boss (citizens of Calgary) do not feel served by their employee (councilor or mayor) then they would fire them</p><p>-Councilor wage freeze and reduction of benefits (also for the ward office staff)  You lead by example pure and simple if you ask Calgarians to buckle down in these tough times you should be the first to do so.   I want a 4 year wage freeze and a 15% reduction in benefits.  I would also pass a motion to reduce the ward office budget by 10%</p><p>-Elimination of Councilor pensions to be replaced by a defined contribution RRSP.    It is not practical to ask tax payers to be on the hook for pensions in the public sector any longer, its a undefined liability that is costing us too much.</p><p>-All city departments are to go to a Zero based budget system.  Simply put these city departments for too long have never had to justify their budgets and as such are increasing year after year, often to add more unneeded management and communications staff not the needed front line workers.   If we need to increase the city budget (which increases taxes) council MUST show they have done everything possible to make it as efficient as possible.  Any budget cuts must start at the management level not front line staff,  front line needs to be protected.</p><p>-Market diversity and red tape.   They are buzzwords yes but only because council does not act on them.  We throw numerous bylaws and permits where they are not needed.  Lets truly look at reducing the number of bylaws when possible and making a standard for something as simple as a business wanting to put a sign up on their own building.     City hall gives blanket permits to construction companies why not charities and community organizations lets let these amazing dedicated groups do their jobs and no burden them with approvals and permits when they are not needed.  If a community organization wants to do a community gathering in a park and they meet the standards set,  they can simply just put on the event.  Sounds simple but administration makes it very hard.</p><p>Lets Put Calgarians back in Charge.</p>",,"<p>My name is Christopher Maitland.  I was born and raised in Calgary and have lived my entire life inside the boundaries of Ward 2.   I'm a proud Calgarian loving every minute living in this great city.</p><p>I attended St. Francis High school in Calgary and then the University of Calgary for Political Science and Economics.  My passion has always been public service and politics,  being involved in politics, community groups and arts organizations has given me the opportunity to give back to my community as well as meet and learn from a vast array of people and experiences.</p><p>I have season tickets to both the Calgary Roughnecks and Stampeders, being a fan for as long as I can remember.   I am also an avid skier and snowboarder I also play soccer and lacrosse.</p><p>My family and friend will describe be as very genuine and loyal.   I believe in being very honest and forthcoming in life as anything else makes for unnecessary complications and limits the ability to communicate and work well with others.   I am married to my wife Cassie and we moved into our home in Evanston after living in Citadel.</p><p>Working as a automotive service advisor I have learned that the single greatest skill in public relations in the ability to listen and understand not just a persons need or problem but the reasoning and background behind it.   If we take a second to truly take in all viewpoints we will come out the other side better every time.</p>",https://www.facebook.com/christophermaitlandward2,,,,,403-589-1169,chris.maitlandward2@gmail.com,

To make sure every tax dollar collected is utilized to maximize value added services and infrastructure to constituents. Many city council members, including the incumbent WARD 2 councilor, voted to keep the City budget unchanged year over year but voted in favour of taking more of the budget for their own salaries, this is not in the best interest of Calgarians and does not increase value added services and improve infrastructure.</p><p>So many Calgarians are either on a tight budget or fixed income. I will focus on making difficult decisions, on what best serves Calgarians, and what is the best use of limited resources to improve quality and abundance of services for Calgarians.</p><p>2)	Accountability and transparency in City Council. The current city council is ineffective. They continue to dip into reserves year over year, without solving the problems and looking at ways to be more efficient. They spend numerous hours in meetings away from the public eye and act in unprofessional and childish ways. Calgarian’s want leadership that shows the voters, and the world, the hard working and creative people who make up this great city. It has been too long that big donors and lobbyists have controlled City Council, and it is time for tax payers to have their voices heard.</p><p>I plan to have active open forums and open dialogue through physical meetings and internet forums so that constituents always have a voice.</p><p>3)	Innovative and effective Public Services. It is not enough to continue doing things the way they have always been done. Public Services and Infrastructure have to be managed in creative and efficient ways that maximize the value added benefits to Calgarian’s without spending more money. For too long City Council has approached services and infrastructure by a method of throwing money at problems and seeing what works. This has been witnessed by never ending expensive reviews and bad financial management. Calgarian’s want a leader who makes the difficult decisions, communicates with their constituents and works with others to find creative ways to solve problems without spending more money.</p><p>4)	Be the future of Canada. Calgary is the youngest and most dynamic city in Canada, and our city council should reflect this. It is time to remove what has not been working and bring in new, young fresh leadership and ideas. Calgary needs leadership that showcases our city and is committed for the long haul. Leadership that focuses on what is best for the families of Calgary. Calgarians have had enough of double dipping councilors and politicians who are out of touch with the modern world. They spend taxpayers money without common sense. We are a youthful and dynamic North American City, our politicians need to showcase this.</p>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvNFa1utAq8,"<p>Bachelor in Kinesiology (minor sociology), University of the Fraser Valley;</p><p>Diploma of Public Relations, University of Victoria;</p><p>Treasurer and Board Member of PMAST (Peer Mediation and Skills Training), a non-profit helping teens mediate conflict and resolve problems;</p><p>15+ years working and managing public recreation facilities (aquatics and recreation);</p><p>5+ years working in Public Relations (political campaigns, NGO, Multi- Nationals);</p><p>10+ years working in public health and safety (first responders);</p><p>Offshore sailing Captain (10,000+ miles of offshore sailing experience); College athlete, Soccer (RDC);</p><p>Jennifer has lived in Calgary for 4 years and has established family routes in Calgary.

This council betrayed even the federal government on this, they proposed one plan to receive funds and then tore up the proposal.</p><p>Harvest Hills Golf Course sold without residents knowledge until a land use application was made and then that notice went to only the homes directly bordering the course. This is an underhanded way to deal with communities, we were forced to scramble without any help from our city councilor. Despite the efforts of the Northern Hills Community Association, Citizens for Responsible Development, over 5000 letters &amp; emails from concerned residents and the attendance for every engagement meeting saying No repeatedly, this course was destroyed. The whole process heavily favors the developers and those developers have to do very little to get approval. This system needs to change and the City needs to set much higher standards for builders and developers in the future. What is the next space they want? Who can you trust to vote for your community.</p><p>Calgarians are out of work in record numbers because of the recession still gripping our province and this city council has done little to focus on jobs and business opportunities. They have failed to react to economic conditions and their solutions as always is to raise taxes. Your taxes and fee increases since 2011 have been raised by 51% and in 2018 after this election they are planning to increase them again.</p><p>Stupid Spending needs to stop, we have to protect our tax dollars and use them to benefit more people. City Council spends a huge amount on ego projects that benefit very few. Some current examples would be;</p><p>Bike lanes costing $5.6 million it’s under budget and a few people are using them they say, but 1.2 million Calgarians can’t ride a bike to work.</p><p>Pedestrian bridges costing $50 million and counting, they go nowhere and while taking photos on the peace bridge is cool that money could have gone into communities with real needs.</p><p>The 1% Art rule, after 13 years this spending program needs a total revamp possibly the money could be redirected more inside of communities, not just downtown and along roadways. I would prefer to see interactive art in playgrounds, school yards and local artists working with local builders on multi use pieces that bring a smile to your face. Stop trying to impress the world and focus spending towards what benefits more Calgarians.</p><p>Common sense and taking care of people needs to be the new rule set by city council. They have failed and changes are urgently needed inside ward 3. Someone new who can’t be bullied or bought and who speaks up for people. Being politically correct does not make you correct. What makes you correct is how you act for people who voted you into the chair and trust you to have their backs.</p>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caz51RD3au0,"<p>Connie Hamilton was born in Calgary, raised in the Nose Creek Valley and continues to lives on what was until 2015 the Harvest Hills Golf Course.

Complaining in a meeting doesn’t work– you need to actually win hearts and minds. Trained as a lawyer, this is what I do – fight for the people I represent using every means at my disposal.</p><p>An example of the current Council ineffectiveness is the Secondary Suites issue, which all members of the current council promised they would fix back in 2013, yet is still taking up 15 to 20% of council time in 2017. What important items are going untouched because Council is wasting their time doing work easily handled by Administration?</p><p>Effective also means working with multiple levels of government, not just sitting in the council sandbox. Major priorities like the Greenline LRT, North Central High School, 14st/Stoney Interchange and others require working together with multiple levels of government. I’m equally comfortable in the bureaucracies of Calgary, Edmonton and Ottawa.</p><p>ACCOUNTABLE</p><p>I will bring transparency and accountability to the City of Calgary. We have a city Council that went “in camera” (a secret meeting) 748 times last year. The city of Toronto only went “in camera” 18 times.</p><p>We have a city that talks a lot about “engagement” but in practice just makes a decision then shows up at meetings to present the finished plan, rather than truly engaging people. This happened with both the Harvest Hills Golf Course and the Greenline LRT, for example. We have public art projects using your money with little to no public input.</p><p>I have professional experience in balancing the need for privacy with the need for transparency, and I know how to achieve that balance by working with everyone involved.</p><p>RESPONSIBLE</p><p>The city of Calgary is facing many issues: population growth, environmental disasters, and an economic downturn. Our downtown has a 30-40% vacancy rate. We live on a flood plain. Despite this, people love this city and keep coming here to live. All of this needs to be managed in a responsible manner.</p><p>We can’t just slash and burn every budget – there are many vulnerable people who need to be cared for. We certainly can’t tax and spend our way out of it. We need to be smart, with heart.</p><p>I’ve got decades of experience with making projects and budgets work. I know when to invest in things that pay off, and when to cut the fat and find efficiencies.</p><p>There are 3 groups – Developers/Business, City Admin, and City Council. Each should act as a check and balance on the others. When we get developers taking over Council, or Council interfering with City Admin, or City Admin interfering with business and development, we have problems.</p><p>I commit to the responsibility of keeping these critical checks and balances in place.</p>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1ddIUgZIVg,"<p>My name is Ian McAnerin and I’ve lived in Calgary Ward 3 for 23 years with my wife Leah and three awesome children, a dog, and 2 cats.</p><p>Originally from Toronto, my family moved a lot when I was young.

IMPROVE COUNCIL TRANSPARENCY.</p><p>I will work for you not the other way around. At a time when so many of our friends and neighbours are suffering from job loss, city hall needs to bring back fiscal discipline and ensure its priority is making Calgary the best place in Canada to do business. Instead they focus on vanity projects and forcing densification plans into our communities. Do you find this as frustrating as I do?</p><p>2.	PROTECT TAXPAYERS.</p><p>It is not acceptable to be bribed with our own money. I greatly value city services but we must live within our means. City council can no longer balance their books on massive year over year tax hikes that exceed inflation. I will hold city hall accountable on taxation and spending, while ensuring Ward 3 gets its fair share of city services.</p><p>3.	DEFEND AND STRENGTHEN OUR COMMUNITIES</p><p>Our current infrastructure is already stretched and strained to service our booming population. Adding to this pressure, new neighbourhoods are being built north of Stoney Trail without additional services like recreation and schools. I will fight to protect our existing recreational facilities, and to ensure that our current green spaces are protected. Further I strongly believe that our ward must get priority for the new Green Line LRT. I will fight to ensure we get no half measures on transit.</p><p>4.	FIGHTING TO GET THE GREEN LINE BUILT NORTHWARDS</p><p>City Council’s decision to terminate the first phase of the Green Line LRT at 16th Avenue is slap in the face to the residents of Ward 3. The Harvest Hills/Centre Street corridor is the busiest bus corridor in the city. In other words, the ridership numbers support building the green line North before anywhere else. Ward 3 deserves access to the kind of high quality, high efficiency transit that LRT provides…and NOW, not 20 years from now. As your councilor, I will fight to get the transit we deserve.</p>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEALUVAODIo,"<p>My wife Hang Jing and I have been proudly raising our three daughters in Panorama Hills since 2010.</p><p>Family is very important to me, and I also greatly enjoy volunteering within the community.</p><p>After immigrating to Canada in 2002, I moved Montreal where I achieved my MBA in Finance from Concordia University.

I have spent my professional life understanding complex urban issues and identifying practical, proven ideas that can be adapted and successfully implemented in Calgary.</p><p>Through my volunteer work in the community, professional experience and involvement on City of Calgary committees, I know how to work within our complex government to meet the expressed needs of residents to bring needed change. Here is my strategy for increased efficiency and effectiveness of City Council:</p><p>1. Accelerate “zero based” departmental reviews to end the practice of regenerating annual budgets without a review of current needs and potential cost savings through partnerships, technology and/or innovative practices.</p><p>2. Increase transparency in decision-making through spending less time behind closed doors. Open decision-making will lead to common understandings of situations, resulting in greater trust between residents and government.</p><p>3. Better facilitation of Council meetings through implementing a pilot project for a rotating Chair or Speaker to identify the strongest Council member for the job. Hiring an external facilitator to manage Council meetings is a waste of money.</p><p>Incorporating this efficiency strategy, I will also tackle the following priorities:</p><p>1. Fight for the needs of Ward 3. Our government partners must step up and invest in much needed improvements in Ward 3, like access to local schools and community amenities, as well as improved traffic management and transit options. I will challenge all 3 levels of government to develop practical solutions for critical infrastructure shortcomings.</p><p>2. Smarter funding models. Traditional funding models for cities involve the unpredictable and slow process of waiting for provincial and federal dollars. More certainty in funding can be achieved through practices like retaining a greater percentage of collected property taxes for our city and utilizing a community revitalization levy for projects in Ward 3.</p><p>3. Address Calgary’s economic challenges. Members of City Council must work with the business community to identify ways to re-establish investors’ faith in our city’s future. We must work together to chart a new path, which includes maximizing the experience of the private sector in municipal partnerships and upgrading our dated approach to property tax assessments.</p><p>4. Support a safe and caring city. The physical and mental wellness of Calgarians is a priority for the municipal government, yet we do not have a seat at the table when federal and provincial decision-makers create social policy. We must be engaged in determining how critical issues like housing, medical treatment and the fentanyl crisis are addressed in our local communities.</p>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SoC8Aj6X7g,"<p>Jyoti has lived, worked and raised a family in Ward 3 for the past 20 years, presently residing in her multigenerational home in Panorama Hills with her husband, 12-year-old daughter and mum.</p><p>Jyoti has spent 5 years on the board of the Northern Hills Community Association and 2 years on the board of Vivo for Healthier Generations.

But we face many challenges, including aging community infrastructure, overloaded public transit, pressure from new development, closing shops and disappearing green spaces. I worry we’re falling behind. Ward 4 deserves a Councillor who will be an informed, effective advocate for our communities. Here’s my plan to make Ward 4 better:</p><p>1. Build Better Connections and Safer Streets</p><p>•The Green Line LRT will end at 16th Ave in Stage One. I’ll fight to bring the Green Line north into Ward 4 and to get all Calgarians a step closer to an Airport train link.</p><p>•Build the long overdue intersection upgrade at John Laurie and McKnight Boulevards.</p><p>•Support cost-effective Bus Rapid Transit projects, especially across North Calgary and not just to downtown.</p><p>•In 2016 Calgary averaged nearly a pedestrian collision per day, and nearly a pedestrian death per month. Let’s make our streets safer for people walking, biking, riding, and driving by investing in infrastructure for all modes of transportation.</p><p>2. Spur Business Growth, Spend Responsibly</p><p>•Make Calgary a top choice for businesses by building on our pro-business environment. Beyond great infrastructure and fair taxation, companies need housing choice, transportation choice and vibrant communities to attract and retain their workforces.</p><p>•Ease the tax burden on small and medium businesses as Calgary’s economy continues to recover.</p><p>•Attract local businesses and services our Ward 4 communities need to thrive.</p><p>•Bend the cost curve on the City’s operating budget by better managing growth.</p><p>•Without major concessions from the IOC, we should not spend billions on the Olympics.</p><p>3. Invest In Our Aging Community Infrastructure</p><p>•Secure our fair share of investment to maintain and improve Ward 4 infrastructure such as parks, libraries, rec centres, arenas, and community centres.</p><p>•Work with school boards to bring more local children to our local schools.</p><p>•Explore sharing opportunities among schools, community groups and seniors.</p><p>•Invest in our precious green spaces that make our communities livable. The Highland Valley development does not benefit our communities and must be reconsidered.</p><p>4. Promote Good, Sensible Development</p><p>•Focus good development — and not just any development — along the edges of our communities, especially along transit corridors like Crowchild Trail and Centre Street.</p><p>•Provide housing choice for our seniors, as well as young adults and their families.</p><p>•Create local plans that respect existing communities and encourage investment in housing and services.</p><p>•End the proliferation of unsafe illegal secondary suites and wasteful Council meetings by properly regulating safe, legal suites.</p><p>Ward 4 deserves more.

My focus has been these issues, and I want to continue the work that I have started with your help. Our Ward is a developed part of the City and as such we have challenges in improving our transit routes, renovating our community hubs, and ensuring that your property taxes are used properly for infrastructure. Needs vs. wants has always been my mantra.</p><p>My largest focus during my first term was on the Green Line, and I succeeded in bringing what was only a line on a map, to construction starting in 2020. We were all disappointed by the City’s news that it would be phased. Nowhere in the reports and countless meetings I had, did the City say this would be the case. I fought for funding for the Green Line for a full 45km track, and will continue this fight if reelected. I have pushed the City to find savings so that we can build it north, and we have done that, so much that we could build it to 40th Avenue, two stops north of 16th Avenue.</p><p>Second, I have also been the fiscal hawk at City Hall and have continuously pressured City Administration to find savings, review City programs, find innovative solutions to cut costs, and always asked my colleagues when we review budgets and spending to ask if this a need or a want. I will remain the defender of your tax dollars. I will continue to push for the City to keep reviewing all department budgets, and promote a culture of innovation in City staff to find ways to cut costs, in order to provide faster and more efficient services. I am also proposing a panel of small business owners and City administration to find ways to help businesses succeed, rather than be a hindrance to success. If small businesses succeed, our City does also.</p><p>Finally, I have focused on practical traffic and pedestrian safety measures that make a difference to you and your family. I have pushed hard for repainting our crosswalks, and installing flashing pedestrian crosswalk signs, speed flashing signals, reflective tape on stop signs, in order to help decrease accidents and make it safer for our kids. I have also worked to make changes to major intersections to make traffic flow safer in rush hour, with more turn lights, and redesigned intersections.</p><p>Better transit for our Ward, fiscal discipline, safety – these have been my areas of focus since 2013, and will continue to be my focus if I earn your support again on October 16th. I have been open, and transparent, and have always treated your tax dollars with respect. With your trust, I hope to continue the work I have started.</p>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GObb_GV9Kws,"<p>Sean Chu arrived to Calgary from Taiwan in 1985 speaking not a word of English, and within 7 years he was a sworn officer with the Calgary Police Service.

This also means being able to answer how much value added work are we citizens getting for each tax $ expended on direct &amp; indirect works and not being satisfied with a simple attribution of each tax $ to various city departments and services.</p><p>I support a robust and rigorous budget planning process based on empirical evidence doing identical work/projects and reliable cost models and oppose phased estimating approaches which invariably under‐estimate costs and risks and over‐estimate benefits and defer the reckoning of project profitability to the very end at which time it is too late. In support of the preceding, the city's external auditor should be tasked with reporting on the Capital spend efficiency @ City.</p><p>To keep businesses competitive and in the interests of tax equity, I support the MMGA (Modernized Municipal Government Act – Bill 21) proposed linked tax ratio of 5:1 and support a franchise fee model based on cost of delivery alone and not total cost of utility supplied, so the volatility of cash flow from this stream is minimized. On the matter of secondary suites (SS) , where safe and all requirements for a secondary suite are met, permissible uses under current zoning should be the basis for approving or rejecting an application and I oppose council looking into every single SS application. On the matter of public art, I believe art is meant to be controversial but will insist on the incorporation of local content while acknowledging that monuments for public art have a tendency to grow on us over time. On the matter of affordable housing, I am committed to stacking municipal efforts on top of the federal governments National housing Strategy (2016) and Affordable housing initiative to replenish and renew affordable housing stock and am for flexible securitization and funding for social housing developers to cover all aspects of pre‐construction financing ( as suggested by <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.fcm.ca"">www.fcm.ca</a> ).</p><p>The first group of regulatory changes to MGA which will come into force just prior to the election were widely discussed and feedback collected online around the issues of collaboration with indigenous communities, enforcement of ministerial orders, parental leave for municipal councillors, environmental stewardship and amalgamations and annexations, I am in agreement with the results/feedback and this agreement can be deemed an extension of my platform outlined in the 3 previous paragraphs.

In 3 years, $7 million dollars has been spent on public art including $471,000 on the Blue Ring and $236,000 on an LED light installation on a NorthEast Water processing plant. While art is important to the community, we need to stop spending money because the current policy permits it; and we need to start focusing on local talent instead of international talent. $5 million was allocated to the Calgary Bid Exploration Committee (CBEC) just to report back to Council of a bid was feasible. Their report came back with a price tag of $50 million to bid and $4.6 billion to host. While some funding can come from the federal and provincial governments, it ultimately comes from the taxpayers. Council agreed to spend $7.1 million on a pilot project for bike lanes in the core at a time when Calgarians are losing jobs and the economy is suffering. That is a spend of $14 million of taxpayers money on wants for our city, not our needs. Line items I would have opposed as your Ward 5 Councillor.

Empowering and listening to the city employees: The front line workers are the ones that understand the most cost effective and efficient opportunities on the ground level when it comes to service delivery.</p><p>The “one for all” service delivery approach is rigidly defined and needs revitalization.</p><p>2.	Affordable housing: Ensure city continuously work with public and private partners and stakeholders to ensure a robust affordable house plan with a diversity of options. The developers must be engaged in policy making to ensure that certain percentage of the new housing is designated for affordable housing. All government agencies must be engaged to leverage their expertise and resources to initiate micro loan and flexible mortgage options for the low income groups.

Create accountability with measuring goals for City spending: I believe that the focus should not be solely on the dollars spent.

I am a strong proponent of investing in our youth, providing opportunities for our seniors and ensuring we are working to build a dynamic productive community. I believe in fiscal responsibility, reducing red tape and greater bylaw enforcement.</p><p>Strong communities are a reflection of how we treat all parts of our community including new Calgarians, those who are less fortunate, seniors and small business owners. Businesses, community associations, cultural and religious groups have to work together to ensure prosperity as well as safe and clean communities. I believe in working with residents and communities to develop an affordable housing strategy as well as enhancing and developing recreational facilities.</p><p>As a young diverse ward, our residents need opportunities to connect and collaborate through community building initiatives. I propose continuing the great work done at the Genesis Center by expanding the Centre to offer more programs for our growing communities but also begin the planning of a new North Calgary Recreation Center which brings residents of Ward 5 together. Opportunities for sports and recreation provide numerous health benefits but also teaches children important life skills such as; teamwork, self-confidence, public speaking, and leadership skills.</p><p>Our ward has a high percentage of new Calgarians who either migrated from other parts of Canada or have immigrated to Canada. Calgarians come from many different socio-economic and cultural backgrounds. We need to listen, understand, and explain the shared Canadian values that bring us together. We need to ensure that all residents become part of the Canadian fabric and the local community. Diversity is the strength of our community, our country and we are stronger together.</p><p>Our city is one of the main growth engines of the Canadian economy. Affordable housing, infrastructure, transit, and fiscal prudence are issues of importance to me. I do believe that we need to prioritize and balance expectations within a fiscal framework. Ultimately, we as taxpayers, will need to fund any increase in expenditures. I strongly believe that property and business tax increases should be held at the rate of inflation and any additional expenditures will need to be balanced by savings. Accordingly, whether we are looking at a new stadium for our professional sports team or a new Winter Olympics initiative; we must ensure that city council works within a fiscal framework that is in the interest of all Calgarians.</p>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR5gjzQVR0Q,"<p>Born &amp; raised in Calgary spending my formative childhood years in Saddleridge.

I am strongly committed to organize &amp; attend the Town Hall meetings in ward‐5 therefore the input of the constituents of ward‐5 could be delivered and shared with the City Council.</p><p>YOUTH’S COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT: As a Provincial Director for Canadian Transplant Association, I am proud to say that I have a large team of volunteers which consists of both youth and adults. It would be one of my top priorities to have the youth engaged from ward‐5 in various community services; therefore, they can understand their responsibilities toward the society.</p><p>SENIOR CITIZEN: Being the Director of the South Asian Canadian Association; which is a Senior Citizen registered society of Calgary, I understand the matters that affect the life of senior citizens. For example, language barrier leaves senior citizens facing with struggle to rebuild their lives &amp; it generates negative emotional &amp; cognitive responses. Use of a computer, how to answer the important phone calls from government authorities are the few big issues of senior citizens to adjust their life in the Canadian system. I will honestly support occasional workshops therefore the senior citizens can share their wealth of skills and experiences with the communities.</p><p>LEGISLATION OF SECONDARY SUITE: A number of residents of ward‐5 want to rent out their basements either to boost their income &amp; help pay down their mortgage or providing accommodations for elderly parents. As a Councillor, my responsibility is to provide knowledge about a legal and safe basement suite.</p><p>CELEBRATION OF CULTURAL FESTIVALS: Ward‐5 has a lot of diversity, and thus there are many different religious and cultural festivals in this ward. A strong input came in while door knocking that these all festivals could be celebrated together to understand each other’s cultural values. I support &amp; will continue to encourage this idea.</p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS: The existing infrastructure requires renovation therefore this could attract residents of ward‐5 for the maximum use of these facilities. Being a Councillor I will try to get funding for this project ASAP.</p><p>LAW &amp; ORDER; In these recent years, the crime rate and drug abuse have increased drastically. I want to organize workshops in ward‐5 frequently to raise awareness among the constituents especially the young generation about these growing issues.</p><p>PROPERTY &amp; BUSINESS TAX: I have met many small business owners who want a good business tax policy and incentives to run their businesses for a long period of time. I will actively play my role on the basis of input from the constituents of ward‐5 before any year end amendments are made by the City</p><p>Council in the property &amp; business taxes.</p><p>I have an honest understanding of the matters that affect our communities in ward‐5.

With this new layout come both some interesting challenges and opportunities.</p><p>On the south side of the ward there are the established neighbourhoods of Castlerigde, Falconridge, Taradale, Martindale and Saddleridge. The greatest challenge to this part of the ward will be to rebuild and renew aging infrastructure. In order to achieve this, a new partnership between the City, individual owners and local businesses must take shape. An agreement that will afford citizens the tools to rebuild their communities in line with today’s standards.</p><p>On the north side of the ward newer communities like Redstone, Skyview Ranch, Savanna, Cornerstone and Cityscape although at earlier stages in their development, lack many essential services, not least a police station and a community center; on the infrastructure side, the lack of funding for future LRT expansion being the most glaring omission by the City.</p><p>Here is how I think we can address these challenges and make Ward 5 an even better place to live:</p><p>1. Safe neighbourhood – while door knocking many of you told me how much you value your family’s safety.  This issue must be addressed; no person should feel unsafe when walking at night or fear for their child’s safety when him/her walk or bike in their neighbourhood. Safety is necessary to any healthy community, which is why I have placed this particular issue at the top of my platform.</p><p>2. Freedom of choice – Our community would be better off if more people had more choices in how they got around – accessing school, work, recreation and other activities. More safe choices to move about the ward and around the city by car, transit, on bike or simply on foot will make our community more resilient and vibrant.</p><p>3. Better public services – Services such as snow removal, maintenance of public spaces and lack of appropriate public lightning are concerns that have keep popping up at the door. This is for good reason as many corners of the NE have been neglected and fallen in disrepair.</p><p>4. Sustainable urban planning  – For too long the city has developed based on a short sided vision, building new districts without access to basic services while allowing existing neighborhoods to decline.  If we want Calgary to thrive and maintain its position as a world class city, we must invest in more resilient models of community building.</p><p>5. Community regeneration: The key to creative, safer, healthier communities is engaging our citizens on topics that are most important to them. More community participation and participatory budgeting is key not only for the NE but for the city at large.</p><p>6. Smart spending – Every person aims to get the most out of their money so too should city hall. With every new project and contract, I will do my very best to make sure that our tax money is being spent with our ward’s and city’s best interest in mind.</p>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIqTd-H-Fl8,"<p>Hello everyone, my name is Tudor Dinca and I am running to represent you, the constituents of Ward 5.

This election will determine how we choose to forge a path ahead for our ward and for our city. The vision that I offer is built on the optimism and hope that is quintessential to being Calgarian. After months of conversations with Ward 6 residents and stakeholders, I have identified four themes that form the foundation of my platform: Strong Economy, World Class Infrastructure, Smart Development, and Safe Communities.</p><p>Strong Economy: The state of Calgary’s economy is at the forefront of the minds of all Calgarians. Whether it is the stress of paying property taxes on our small business, the anxiety of being included in the next round of layoffs, or trying to put food on the table, not one of us has emerged unscathed from the economic downturn. Calgarians and Ward 6 residents value fiscal responsibility. Through providing economic relief for residents and small businesses, as well as encouraging innovation and advocating for a competitive business environment that draws in investors from all over the world, we can build a strong economy.</p><p>World Class Infrastructure: For our economy to be competitive, we need to have world class infrastructure - the kind that makes our city a place where the best and brightest minds from all over the world want to come and live. We also need to maintain the infrastructure we have already invested in - like our roads and transit systems.</p><p>Smart Development: Calgary is constantly attracting new residents and as a result, our city is growing. In 2016, Ward 6 was one of six wards in the city to see an increase in its population. This growth brings change as our ward and city adapt to the needs of our new community members. Smart development is needed to preserve what we love about our communities while accommodating the changes that come with increased density.</p><p>Safe communities: Our neighbourhoods and communities serve as the building blocks of our city, province and country. They are the places we live in and for us to be able to enjoy them, we have to make sure that they are great environments for everyone. We care about our neighbourhoods and we want to make sure that they remain great places to raise our families, grow old, form friendships with our neighbours, and feel like we belong.</p><p>Calgary is at its best and most successful when it looks to the future with hope, a desire for innovation and the belief that we are and will continue to be a vibrant land of opportunity. The platform I have put together reflects these values and the months of engagement that I have done with residents and stakeholders.

Here is part of my plan.</p><p>1.	Charity begins at home. Keep employment here before we seek other professionals and experts from outside our city. Let’s ensure we have given our homegrown talent a chance to work with us. Also, potential bidders should disclose to the public, the percentage of sourcing of local goods, materials and services.</p><p>2.	Effective communication between businesses, City departments, and Neighbourhoods</p><p>Residents want to be more engaged in decision at planning and implementing stages of our infrastructure projects. Effective communication between stakeholders can avoid   disappointments and negative response to projects at approval and completion stages. Recent examples are: public art and sculpture, Seniors’ Associations, the South West Ring Road, more traffic lights, affordable housing, construction, secondary suites, direct light fixtures, traffic concerns, Parks and Recreation, public events draw. Let us know that clearly, we can do better.</p><p>3.	Preserve the institutions that have made us unique.</p><p>Our hospitals, the Saddledome, Olympics Training Facilities, museums and post-secondary institutions are just some of the institutions which shape our Calgary identity. Let’s maintain that friendly Western hospitality and show the world that we welcome diversity and inclusiveness. Visitors and new arrivals to our city make important contributions to our economy. We want to keep moving forward while ensuring we maintain our peaceful lifestyle.</p><p>4.	Maintain Calgary as a resilient, prosperous and thriving City</p><p>Our frequent boom, flood, burn and bust cycles must not continue or we will lose the soul of the City. We need to be more resilient and diversified economically, so we don’t feel the pinch. Our empty business spaces need to be filled with businesses that can sell their services and products to an employed market. Lower taxes on small businesses and provide easy access to these establishments. We must make our transit system efficient.  Long travel times are unacceptable.  Residents should not have to pay high admission costs to visit the interactive Museums. We must have quick access to a Reserve Emergency fund when disaster hits and be well prepared for such events.</p><p>5.	Encourage research and education initiatives</p><p>As we transition to an environmentally sustainable lifestyle, Calgary needs encouragement in research and education to make this possible and to create jobs in this City that I love. This includes implementing policies that encourage safe and affordable housing for all demographics.</p><p>These ideas and suggestions were given to me by the thousands of households that I have visited over this campaign period.</p><p>Let us continue to share our wisdom and our vision for Calgary.</p><p>Go with Grace!</p>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-70C3eqMpM,"<p>I am Grace Nelson.

I made a significant contribution as a certified school teacher, mostly in Calgary schools.</p><p>Because I always strive to make things better, I have been involved with leadership and policy making in my work for many school, community associations, non-profit and condominium boards, including the Alberta Teachers` Association.</p><p>Recently, I received the Bolide Award from the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada – Calgary Centre.</p><p>I am honoured to be recognized as a volunteer fireball for Calgary!</p><p>I have led multiple fundraising events. The result has been the funding of programs that would otherwise not exist.</p><p>Goal-setting is a key part of my work as an entrepreneur, educator, athlete, mother, sales representative and humanitarian.</p><p>My maturity and experience has prepared me for Calgary City Council and that is why it is important to elect me now.</p>",https://www.facebook.com/gracenelson4yyc/,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/grace-nelson4ward6/,https://twitter.com/gracenelsonyyc,,403-264-3844,gracenelson4yyc@gmail.com,http://www.gracenelson4yyc.ca/

I am a firm believer that leadership needs to come from our elected officials and I will not vote for any salary increases in my first term as councilor if I am elected.</p><p>I will also pledge to attend as many events and community association meetings as I can to help ensure that I am always listening to the concerns of the residents of Ward 6 and representing your views to our City Council.</p><p>Fiscal Responsibility:</p><p>Research by the Canadian Taxpayers Federation concluded Calgary’s property taxes increased almost three times the rate of inflation between 2005 and 2015. Research by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business shows that municipal spending in Calgary and Edmonton increased two and a half times faster than inflation and population growth between 2005 and 2015.</p><p>I am pledging to keep our property tax increases as low as possible and I will strive for ways to deliver efficiency and eliminate wasteful and unnecessary spending.  Calgary is still a growing city that needs to balance the delivery of essential services, recreation, and a high quality of life with a responsible and accountable level of budgetary spending.</p><p>Traffic and Congestion:</p><p>Anyone that has lived in Ward 6 over the last decade knows that traffic and congestion are serious issues of concern.</p><p>I will pledge to take a careful look at all development projects to ensure that any increases in density will be managed with transportation planning and infrastructure projects so that we are not impacted with further traffic and congestion issues.</p><p>Transparency:</p><p>The current City of Calgary Council spends more time than any other major city in Canada in meetings that are in camera. These meetings are closed to the public and members of the media.</p><p>I will pledge to push for a reduction in the number of meetings that are being held under this veil of secrecy.</p><p>Economic Development:</p><p>In the ten years from 2002 to 2012, small businesses in Canada were responsible for 77.7% of all jobs created in the private sector; however, only half of new firms (51%) survive their fifth year of operation.</p><p>Government policies and taxation at the Federal, Provincial and Municipal level can all have a significant impact on the ability for our businesses to thrive and succeed. Employment in Calgary has seen significant challenges during the current economic downturn and our city council can have a direct influence on the viability of the businesses that we create and the employment growth that these companies generate.</p><p>I will pledge to find ways to support our local businesses so that they can be successful and continue to provide high quality employment opportunities.</p>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IfO39fpPGE,"<p>I have lived in Calgary for 40 years and I have lived in the community of West Springs for almost 10 years.

It’s time we put efficiency, collaboration and accountability back in city council.</p><p>As your next Ward 6 Councillor, I will fight effectively to see that our next administration moves away from a tax and spend philosophy to focus on a collaborative agenda of sensible spending priorities over the long‐term.</p><p>I will fight to champion these key priority areas:</p><p>•	Ensuring the needs of Ward 6 are prioritized by fostering proactive and collaborative development between citizens and City Hall</p><p>•	Developing sustainable communities that are vibrant and safe for all our citizens</p><p>•	Improving operational efficiencies and developing responsible cost control strategizes that focus on prioritizing our needs</p><p>Any campaign worthy of Ward 6 and this great city must have a strong foundation. To the residents of my home, Ward 6, here is what I say to you:</p><p>I will ensure the needs of Ward 6 are not overlooked. We deserve a leader who will work proactively and collaboratively to put the needs of our communities first. My goal is to ensure Council hears our collective voice on all growth and development matters—before projects are approved, not after.</p><p>I will build and develop safe and vibrant communities. When it comes to the well‐being of all of our citizens, only safer, thriving communities will suffice. I want to proactively collaborate with you as we plan for tomorrow, not react to the needs of yesterday. Whether you are parents on the go or busy professionals, effectively managing growth and significantly improving traffic flow in our Ward will help make your day a little easier.</p><p>I will focus on cost control. How does large‐scale spending affect our Ward and all Calgarian’s? We deserve to know the answer every time the city opens its coffers. I will push for prioritized spending that meets rigorous cost‐benefit testing. I will drive for increased efficiencies, streamlined regulations and lower costs at City Hall. By reining in extensive tax increases and wasteful spending, we will support stronger financial controls that will benefit of all our citizens.</p><p>I will never forget my first priority – you, the residents of Ward 6! You are my friends, my family and my neighbours. Each and every one of you have a voice and I want to hear you make a statement on October 16th by voting Jeff Davison, Councillor for Ward 6. Together, we can put efficiency, effective collaboration and true accountability back in city council.</p>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDNb7b8QJ_g,"<p>Ward 6 deserves a strong voice.

Demanding City Hall respects taxpayers and delivers results</p><p>• 	Taxes have gone up more than 50% in the past eight years – Calgarians have not seen a 50% improvement in services.

We should put that money to good use and deliver tangible results for Calgarians.</p><p>3.

Accountability and Common Sense</p><p>If we look at city halls track record, notably in the last 8 years we’ve seen a shift from politics of the people to politics of the egos, corporations and special interest groups.  That has resulted in economical disasters.  In all cases there is a distinct lack of public input, accountability by the City of Calgary and common sense.  Instead of just talking about the problems Marek Hejduk is proposing some solutions with any public input welcome.  Unless we reverse the course holding our public officials accountable to the people who are voting for them we will see higher taxes, more boondoggles, and egoist spending on vanity projects inside city limits.</p><p>2. Secondary Suites in the City</p><p>Marek Hejduk would propose an office that handles secondary suites that includes home inspectors to ensure that the secondary suites are up to fire and safety code as well as monitoring and accordingly charging rental units that wish to become Airbnb hotels.</p><p>3. Olympic Bid</p><p>There is a lot of controversy around the Olympic bid.  We also have to face a few economic facts; is this really the time to spend money and get farther into debt with rising interest rates, low oil prices with no recovery on the horizon, a higher than national average unemployment rate and skyrocketing cost of living.  Things may well recover in the future, for now we should let the Olympic bid lie until we are all financially and emotionally prepared for it.</p><p>4.

A student of life, he has multiple certificates in a variety of subjects ranging from IFIC (Investment Funds Institute of Canada) licensing, AIC (Alberta Insurance Council) licensing, PROSCI Change Management certification, Lean Six Sigma Green Belt, Oilfield Safety Training, Novell Network Certificate, Microsoft Network Certification, Teaching Adults Certificate.

I will ensure we see the elimination of business taxes, reduce burdensome red tape, and make Calgary the best city in Canada to start and grow a new business.</p><p>I support Calgary’s business improvement areas (BIAs) and their important role in promoting their members’ businesses and attracting Calgarians to their districts.  I will not support any new initiatives by City Council to manage or control these independently funded and managed organizations.</p><p>TRUST &amp; ACCOUNTABILITY</p><p>I will work to rebuild trust between City Council and everyday Calgarians, throw open the doors of City Hall, and work with a new generation of municipal leadership to stamp out a culture of entitlement that has taken hold at City Hall.</p><p>I will support the elimination of texting and smart phone use during public hearings of City Council. I will move to get public business back in front of the public, with the elimination of closed door meetings for all matters other than personnel items and sensitive contractual issues.</p><p>I will ask that Council review its governance role on many of the boards, committees and commissions where it currently has representation or membership.  Independent oversight of these agencies may be compromised by this continued direct participation by Council or its members.</p><p>SENSIBLE DEVELOPMENT</p><p>With over 27 years of municipal development experience, I know that local communities are best positioned to provide meaningful input on what kind of development is right for their neighbourhoods. While Council has to make the final decision on land use matters, I will reform the local consultation process so that it puts neighbourhoods first. Recognizing that all cities must evolve, planning of cities should not be all “top down” ‐ it should be a collaborative process where the local citizens’ voices matter.</p><p>MOVING CALGARY FORWARD</p><p>Calgary and Calgarians have a history of rebounding from setbacks.  The downturns following the Turner Valley boom in 1914 and the doldrums of the mid‐20th Century were followed by periods of tremendous growth.  We may not see a similar dramatic turnaround over the next four years, but we must take steps to prepare for it.  The current 30+ per cent downtown vacancy rates and abundance of residential housing are an opportunity for growth. Calgarians need experienced and visionary leadership for the next four years.</p>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwx_5Hmw8Ag,"<p>With over 25 years of direct involvement in Alberta municipal matters, I bring a wealth of experience to City Hall. I worked as a planning and development lawyer with the City’s law department for eight years and in private practice for over 19 years.  I have seen the development process from all sides. I fought for homeowners and local communities against poor development plans and a sometimes interventionist City Hall. I acted for developers and property owners, as they brought their vision of community building to life.  My experience inside and outside of government has given me a balanced perspective ‐ knowing that while good development is always necessary, not all development is necessarily good!</p><p>My family are 3rd generation Calgarians.

Fair measures are needed to reduce the tax burden on homeowners and small businesses.  Lower taxes will benefit all taxpayers.</p><p>Keep Housing Affordable</p><p>Current City planning and restrictive land‐use policies are making housing more expensive to purchase and to be able to remain living in.  These crippling policies need to be changed.

I believe that we have fundamentally weak communication between communities and the City Hall. It is clear from constituent’s feedback that the present effort and strategies are not good enough. I will work hard to build and strengthen that communication.</p><p>The geo-political security situation over the world has become precarious. We cannot let our guard down and making Calgary a safer city is my top priority. This will require input from all communities with strong leaders to represent them at City Hall.</p><p>Corruption of all kinds has been plaguing our society. This, along with wasteful expenditure must stop. I will fight vigorously to curb the waste and increase accountability.</p><p>The balance between business’ and homes are the cornerstone of a successful, thriving development and taxation must be fair and justified. I will ensure that this will be done equitably and with a friendly, inclusive approach. The City of Calgary has increased taxes where I believe more funding should come from other levels of government. City councillors are using property dollars to pay for things that the provincial and federal government should be responsible for. One area of focus will be to shift the financial burden to higher levels of government.</p><p>I think it is time to stop talking and start demonstrating from a leadership prospective that we are not only listening but we’re are actually hearing what Calgarians have to say and understand what Calgarians needs are. I think that what we are lacking right now is a better understanding of the actual needs of the city and its citizens rather than wasteful spending on controversial “art”.</p><p>Cities grow and evolve based on resources, support, opportunities’ and development. Smart, dynamic, innovative and futurist’s ideas will ensure that our city of Calgary will always stays at the top and flourish. We cannot live in the past, bright ideas will help in a consistent growth of the people and communities. I will dedicate all my energies toward these goals.</p><p>Calgary should be governed by Calgarians and those who feel passionate about their future.</p><p>Among my top priorities will be to implement your ideas and plans for a bright future that continue to place Calgary among the top livable cities in the world year after year.</p>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ1MzD1ajnA,"<p>Boss Madimba was born in Republic Democratic of Congo (Ex Zaire) to devout Catholic Parents in 1975.</p><p>He immigrated to London, Ontario, Canada in 1996 and completed his Degree in Business Administration at CDI College, while at the same time working in a fast upscale environment building truck frames with Magna international.

I believe that addressing these three issues will result in more engaged and prosperous communities that feel connected to our city.</p><p>The Ward 9 communities deserve to be as dynamic as any other part of Calgary, for this to be possible there needs to be a considerable update to key landmarks in our neighborhoods and create ones where now none exist. Things such as community name signage, well-kept lawns and recreational areas all add to the well-being of our constituent’s day to day experience. This also pertains to the aesthetic level of our local businesses’ areas, I aim to work with owners and developers alike to locate appropriate improvements to public and private infrastructure that pertains to municipal jurisdiction, and greater works through provincial funding.</p><p>All these improvements must come with a level of safety, for property and more importantly to the people that will make use of new areas and drive the economy of existing and emerging businesses. Communities have to work with the CPS and CFD, to drive home the fact that they are there to serve our needs in terms of safety, as the professionals that they are. Residents should feel protected and the municipality has to work to make sure that a level of trust is built for and felt by residents. I aim to develop neighborhood activities, safety fairs and other mediums in which to achieve this. I believe that this will help reduce and prevent crime and other kinds of violence.</p><p>Last but not least, I believe that a healthy society, of mind and of body, is one that can create great things. For this reason, I believe that we should take our community involvement seriously, to offer a variety of programs that will incite constituents to participate, be it sport tournaments or art events and programs. This can also include partnerships with schools and the Calgary Board of Education (CBE). We have a very diverse multicultural human capital in our neighborhoods, and we should connect with all of them, to bring people close together and participate in fun and fulfilling projects. This will also open a flood of community leadership and creativity that can only lead to make our neighborhoods vibrant and find its own voice within the city.</p><p>Councillors have a duty to represent their electorate and the municipality itself, they should be held to the highest accountability. Regardless of where one lives, residents are to be respected, and deserve to be considered, to be included in the development of THEIR city. This is why I’m running for Councillor, being aware of the responsibility it demands, to uphold the pledge of working for the people.</p>",,"<p>My name is Cesar Saavedra, I moved to Calgary almost 20 years ago from Montreal by way of Lima, Peru, and like many of you I have seen the city grow into what it is today, a conglomerate of diverse ethnicities that seek to thrive and prosper. I’m also completely fluent in French and Spanish, and during this time I have prepared myself in academia at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology in management, and completing now a bachelor’s degree in Political sciences from the University of Calgary. But, more importantly I have observed how the city’s growth has not reached everyone, including communities in the southeast.</p><p>Communities like Forest Lawn, Penbrook and Dover to name a few, have been left behind, one can just look at the dated infrastructure to notice that little to no attention has been given by our elected authorities. Yet, I don’t believe in just throwing money at a problem, rather, that growth has to include input and engagement from local residents, that we need to allow leadership within our communities to help create areas that residents will be proud of, and newcomers will appreciate.</p><p>I strongly believe in city building from the bottom-up, one that reflects our values and dignity. It has become clear in recent times that our authorities have become disconnected to the needs of Calgarians, and it is up to us to inspire and achieve positive change for all.

After three successful years of changing hearts and minds and beginning the process of overhauling our municipality’s rules, regulations and processes, I refined my focus to Great Neighbourhoods—a five‐point transformation of the direction and structure of our municipal government.</p><p>At the centre of this work is the understanding that Great Neighbourhoods make a great city.</p><p>I believe this idea has never been more important than it is today. As people fleeing hatred and strife look to Canada, and Calgary, as a beacon of safety and opportunity in a stormy world; as our city’s core industry ‐ oil and gas ‐ faces a structural change and the long‐discussed ideal of economic diversification has become a pressing need on which our future survival and success depends; and as we realize, along with cities across North America, that the kind of city we’ve spent the last several decades building presents significant challenges to our environment, to our ability to care for one another effectively, to our health and to our financial future—Great Neighbourhoods is a collective project of city‐building that mitigates our existing risks and embraces the amazing opportunities that Calgary’s considerable strengths put within our reach.</p><p>As Calgary sits at these crossroads, I believe the neighbourhoods of East Calgary embody a different and better path forward. While our City has never been more diverse than it is today, too often people who come from the same backgrounds, who make the same amount of money, who believe the exact same things, choose to live apart from everyone else in their own cul‐de‐sacs and enclaves.</p><p>East Calgary is different.</p><p>In East Calgary, all the people of Calgary live together in diverse neighbourhoods, close to where we work and shop and learn and worship and play. It is in East Calgary that the community we build together will reflect the best promises of Great Neighbourhoods.</p><p>I’m extremely proud of the progress we’ve made towards Great Neighbourhoods over the last seven years and I’m deeply excited by the opportunity to continue this work representing a unified East Calgary within Ward 9.</p>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OGP_UxQWz4,"<p>My name is Gian‐Carlo Carra and along with my wife Barb and my son Vance, I’m proud to call Ward 9 home.</p><p>My vision of Calgary is a sustainable, thriving, culturally rich network of great neighbourhoods.</p><p>Before becoming a member of City Council in 2010, I drove a school bus in Forest Lawn, served sandwiches at Spolumbo’s and coached outdoor sports.

It is not right to make these people pay the same level of taxes while they face constant risks. The level of risk and insecurity makes it harder to make any viable profit from a business perspective. Properties lose value due to high level of crime and insecurity. The special tax intends to bring more investors while maintaining those who are already here and keep those jobs we so need. The more business we bring or keep in the area can lead to the gentrification of the area.</p><p>A free daycare program.</p><p>Giving free day care to low income families, working poor, single parents (man or a woman) and those who want to go to school but who happen to have a child or children make sense not only economically but also socially if we need to lift up people out of poverty.</p><p>A job program for vulnerable.</p><p>All city contractors will be required to set aside a certain % of its labor force for homeless people who want and are able to work.</p><p>A secure Neighborhood.</p><p>SE Calgary has been ignored for too long. We need to work with all classes of people, from church leaders, community heads, community association presidents, local organizations and any other stakeholders that is affected by crime and insecurity in SE Calgary to sit down and share ideas and develop strategy that will make sure SE Calgary is safe like any other area in Calgary. We can’t keep relying on traditional means to solve our problems.</p><p>A community based approach to solve problems.</p><p>We will start dealing with problems at the community level instead of the common lip service we see every day from our current councilor. They pretend to consult us but in the end decision are taken in corporate offices in downtown Calgary.</p><p>A sound educational program that reaches every child.</p><p>With educational organizations, including Calgary Library, we are going to improve on existing programs to make sure that no child is left behind when it comes to tutoring program. We may require sending qualified high, college or University students to go house to house where children live and tutor them from their own houses. This will also lead to part time job opportunities for students.</p><p>Affordable housing for all.</p><p>This is an ongoing issue. The council need to be serious and that is what I intend to do, fighting for more affordable housing for those who need them.</p><p>Social infrastructures for all.</p><p>Our social infrastructures are old and obsolete. Our parks need major upgrading.</p><p>Erect a counseling centre for all.</p><p>A well funded counseling centre is needed in Ward 9 to make sure those who need this crucial service get it. Many of our youths need this service.</p>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSR-48M0lZ8,"<p>I was born in the Democratic Republic of Congo but studied in different countries.

Assist Calgary’s economic recovery by speeding up the time for planning and licensing</p><p>Our businesses have been struggling with tax rates that are among the highest in the country and an ever increasing wait times for planning and development approvals. Costing businesses time, money and stress while losing out on opportunities. There is a huge disconnect between City Hall and small business. I will ensure City Hall understands the importance to completing applications much more quickly so that our businesses can activate their companies faster.</p><p>2.	Reassess the use of Public Spaces</p><p>In many of the communities throughout our city, the Community Associations (CA’s) are struggling to attract new volunteers, support existing ones, and keep the community halls in good condition. I would like to reassess the uses of our CA Halls and engage the community to determine their best use. It is imperative that we respect and focus on the needs of our more culturally diverse communities.  Ward 10 has has changed culturally and many CA’s have been unable to keep pace with that change.</p><p>3.	Fix the 36th Street corridor</p><p>The City has created an absolute disaster of transportation infrastructure along the 36 Street corridor.

I am the Councillor that can make partnerships that will be able to realistically develop the corridor to be a shining example of community supported development.</p><p>4.	Community support for our youth:</p><p>Encouraging our youth to use public spaces contributes to a healthy community. Bringing our youth together in a healthy and active ways also promotes more eyes on our streets leading to safer communities. We need a large component of recreational and cultural programming to be centred around supporting our youth.</p><p>5.	Business Improvement Areas</p><p>I will be proposing the idea of a commercial and industrial “Business Improvement Areas” (BIA). The benefits of the communities levying themselves and retaining all of their business taxes will benefit them immediately and provide the flexibility they need to decide where their resources are best utilized. Also, serving to create safer and more beautiful spaces.</p><p>6.  Term Limits</p><p>I want to change to our current election policies to support a limit of 3 terms as Councillor or Mayor. I feel that it is important that Calgary continues to have new energy and new ideas on Council. In most cases there seems to be a lack of enthusiasm/engagement of Councillors that have been in Council for over 3 terms.</p><p>7.   Open opportunities to develop residential in commercial and industrial districts</p><p>⅓ of Ward 10 is comprised of solely commercial and industrial lands.

I will stand alongside business owners in campaigning against the red tape and the rigorous processes to encourage entrepreneurship.</p><p>•	I will tackle the affordable housing crisis. We do not need to only build more affordable homes, we need to ensure that the current ones are maintained, and the people living in these homes have the means to maintain them.

So I kept running in this direction. I saw first-hand the impact that opportunities and support can have on people’s lives—and this has made me determined to fight and advocate for this right.

Until our City has new business plans to help rebuild our City’s economy focusing on different types of business and industries that will grow rapidly within the next 5-10 years.</p><p>REDUCE CRIME TO CREATE SAFE &amp; SECURE COMMUNITIES</p><p>Hiring security guards with patrol vehicles costs less &amp; will create more employments. Hiring more police officers in Calgary &amp; NE as the City adopts the legalization of marijuana use. Community halls be used for youth oriented programs; drop in centers with multicultural programs to help develop new talents &amp; healthier lifestyles.</p><p>SAFER PEDESTRIAN CROSSING</p><p>C-Train crossings need automatic interlocking gates installed immediately to avoid further accidental deaths. New flashing lights with barricade bars vertical &amp; horizontal need to be installed to avoid traffic driving into oncoming trains. New pedestrian cross walks need to be painted by every mailbox for safe &amp; easy accessibility.</p><p>BALANCED COMMUNITY PLANS</p><p>Building 200 units in Martindale increases lower income population in NE. All future developments &amp; upgrades should be up to the beltline level. The future East Stony Area Structure Plan which includes approximately 225 acres of undeveloped land in NE Calgary, east of Stoney Trail should increase the development standard to beltline. Which will able the residences &amp; business owners with school age children to drop &amp; pick children from school. NE &amp; surrounding area residence will be employed closer to home &amp; encourages fewer vehicles on our streets.</p><p>36 STREET TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE</p><p>A safer redesigning &amp; structure is needed to accommodate the growing population of drivers, bikers &amp; pedestrians. Residences use the LRT to commute to work in evenings &amp; in winter walk home or to nearby bus stops. Daily commute is a reality for most residence of Ward 10. The City of Calgary needs to ensure adequate planning for our future transportation needs by improving public transportation &amp; road planning. Our communities can be made more walkable &amp; safe through more proactive assessment of the needs of the community &amp; the increase use of cross walks &amp; street lights.</p><p>AFFORDABLE ASSISTED LIVING</p><p>Seniors are our growing population in Ward 10.  City of Calgary needs to encourage stakeholders &amp; business owners to invest in senior assisted living homes in NE. Many of our seniors are forced to move into senior homes away from their close families &amp; friends. It becomes difficult for families and friends to frequently visit their loved ones  living in different quadrants and cities.</p>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbg6ylk9xvE,"<p>Kamilla Prasad was born in the Fiji Islands.

I strongly believe in a healthy democracy and have been involved in politics in Ward 10 since 2011. I have held positions from secretary to president, in different electoral riding associations at both provincial and federal levels. I have submitted and passed policies within the current democratic structure for our areas. I ask leaders in our area if they would consider running - youth, women and people of marginalized communities. I was a Samara Canada 2015 Everyday Political Citizen nominee and understand where and why there are gaps of Indigenous inclusion and used that experience to advocate for other communities outside of the Indigenous so that everyone is included.</p><p>SAFETY: A lack of safety can mean anything from cat-calling, to traffic lights, signs and signals, car accidents, natural disasters, or just being able to safely walk to a bus stop after a snowfall. While safety means different things to different people, it also means having a child be able to safely ride their bike to pools or libraries, and not struggling with roads, transit and a stroller. I have been part of Community Action Team Walks – CAT Walks, that include bylaw and police officers where volunteers can ask questions and learn in a setting of non-emergency to increase community pride, decrease crime, and to get to know neighbours. I was introduced to concepts of safety and crime prevention through environmental design through organizations like Safegrowth (trademarked) that realize community led initiatives. I attended harm reduction meetings which brought many groups to the table to see where we have commonalities to solve issues in positive, constructive ways. I was able to talk about intergenerational traumas and bring solutions to the table informed by my individual Indigenous perspective. As a community organizer of vigils for Indigenous peoples’ in our area, I see these issues with a broader perspective.</p><p>INCLUSION:  I believe inclusion is related to safety. I have family that identify as part of the LGBTQ2+ communities. I see the homophobia and transphobia hurt others. I see how the Indian Residential School taught bullying and put many youth today at risk for homelessness and add to the issue of missing and murdered Indigenous people. With poverty reduction, an Indigenous lens is needed to tackle issues of long standing history and I want to implement solutions.</p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE: Having been part owner in a geomatics supply business and working in the city, I knew how limited our choices were getting to work. These are infrastructure issues in an established area that could be looked at with community outreach that works for all. I’m uniquely qualified to be in a position of governance as we tackle secondary suite issues.  Teamwork will be key.</p>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A35W1aSgyDc,"<p>I am Michelle Robinson, a proud mother, wife, owner of 2 dogs (3 in my heart,) a proud Dene, Flames fan, and Calgarian.

My background is in the oil and gas industry, geomatics, crime prevention, family violence prevention, poverty and harm reduction, and cultural diversity education with police inclusion.</p><p>My passion is in creating healthy and safe communities where all can thrive. I support families of missing and murdered Indigenous people here by volunteering with the Sisters in Spirit Committee. I volunteer with the LBGTQ2+ community by passing policies of inclusivity and continuing to advocate. I work on policy development on many issues at both federal and provincial levels.

Over the past four years I have heard from many of the residents and some of their concerns are included in my platform:  Community Development, Safety &amp; Transportation, Affordable Housing and lastly Accountability.</p><p>1.	Community Development</p><p>I will continue to enhance our communities and increase community pride with programs such as: The Annual Ward Community Cleanup, Rundle Area Master Plan and Legacy Parks. I am currently, investigating the installation of artificial turf in a centrally located area within ward 10 for a multipurpose field to be used by all ages.</p><p>2.	Safety &amp; Transportation</p><p>I support cost effective public transit and the enhancement of neighborhood community policing to ensure the safety and enjoyment of all our neighborhoods for our residents and businesses.  I will insist on the continuation of investments into our LRT service, station upgrades and ongoing monitoring of effective use of bus routes. I will continue to support communities and their residents with the Community Resource police staff at District 4 and 5 Police Stations.</p><p>3.	Affordable Housing</p><p>I will maintain my support for affordable housing such as Habitat for Humanity, Senior's low-cost housing and secondary suite reform. Our population is aging, both in the smaller communities and throughout the city, we need to be able to readily meet their needs at an affordable price.  As well, i believe we need to develop a system that addresses secondary suites as an effective way to increase affordable units for low income families and individuals.</p><p>4.	Accountability</p><p>I'm determined to keep City spending restrained, city resources and facilities utilized effectively and spending warranted, meeting the needs of Calgarians.  Over the past 24 years, I've consistently been below my allocated ward budget and have returned funds back to The City year after year.  I believe in fiscal responsibility of The City and will revisit their budgets to keep them on track again in the Fall. On a personal note, I will continue to listen to your concerns, take action on your behalf to resolve your issues and will continue to collaborate with your community association leaders.</p><p>In the past years of serving on City Council, I have seen the booms and the busts and with the recent downturn in our economy it is more important now than ever for Council to work collaboratively and to have meaningful consultations with the development industry and to liaise between them and civic administration. We should be working together to achieve the same goals of building a great and vibrant city.</p>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwJGBkn-yyI,"<p>In October 2013, Councillor Ray Jones was re-elected to Calgary City Council to represent the citizens of Ward 5 for an eighth term.  He is now the longest standing Councillor on Calgary City Council this term.</p><p>A resident of the Rundle community since 1977, and past president of eight years, Ray still is an active volunteer and a leading member on a variety of community, municipal and provincial committees dealing with issues impacting Northeast Calgary.</p><p>In recognition of Ray's dedicated service to the communities and to the citizens of the city of Calgary he has been awarded several Honourary Memberships, including:</p><p>Honorary Lifetime Director of Calgary Exhibition and Stampede</p><p>Honorary Patron of Calgary Meals on Wheels</p><p>Honorary Lifetime Member of the Whitehorn Community Association</p><p>Lifetime Member of the Falconridge/Castleridge, Pineridge, Rundle, Temple Community Associations,  N.E. Sportsplex Society and Calgary Grey Cup Committee</p><p>In recognition of his significant contributions to compatriots, community and to Canada, Ray was the recipient of the Governor General's of Canada Award in 1993. In 2003, he received the Queen's Golden Jubilee Award for Community Service, 2005 he received the Alberta Centennial Metal and in 2012 the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal.</p><p>With the recognition Ray Jones has received in the past, his interest in the quality of life for the youth and residents of Ward 5 and the citizens of Calgary is well known.</p>",https://www.facebook.com/RundleRay,,,https://twitter.com/RundleRay,,587-535-6247,aldjones@telus.net,

Thriving neighbourhoods:  If we work together, we can go further in achieving thriving neighbourhoods.  I commit to establishing open lines of communication and accessibility so the office of Ward 11 can work hand‐in‐hand with community associations, businesses, organizations and engaged citizens to understand and respond to the needs of residents.  I support:</p><p>∙  Good walkability and proximity to commercial centres, community assets and recreation spaces</p><p>∙  Neighbourhoods of diversity; with a range of density, activity, and ways to get around</p><p>∙  Resilient communities that withstand demographic changes with well‐attended schools and safe streets for our kids to play</p><p>∙  Secondary suites and low‐rise densification, but with significant room for improvement and efficiency in the application, design and approval process</p><p>∙  Approaches to keep community members engaged, active and in their homes through initiatives such as the Age‐friendly strategy, Community Hubs, cycle tracks and before‐ and after‐school programs</p><p>2.	Supports for Families and Communities: Our whole city will be better off socially and economically if we put people and communities first; invest in families; and make sure the voices of the most marginalized Calgarians are heard. As your Councillor, I will:</p><p>∙  Champion the non‐profit sector in Calgary, building on many years of collaboration and relationshipbuilding</p><p>∙  Advocate for increases to Family and Community Support Services</p><p>∙  Continue in my work to enhance the municipal system of Early Learning and Child Care</p><p>∙  Work closely with the many stakeholders in the private, non‐profit and public sectors who provide affordable housing in our city</p><p>∙  Take a rights‐based approach to decision‐making and commit to meaningful engagement with user groups, the voice of lived experience and subject matter experts to ensure all perspectives are heard.</p><p>3.	A city our kids can be proud of: I want City Hall to show courage and leadership and make some tough choices that will lead to a vibrant urban centre in the 21st century and beyond. I want Calgary to be a well‐maintained city that is fiscally prudent, environmentally conscious, and socially‐minded.  To achieve the city I want for future generations, I will:</p><p>∙  Advocate for a robust, convenient public transit, pathway and cycle track system</p><p>∙  Support plans that look ahead to the changing nature of work, autonomous vehicles and the sharing economy</p><p>∙  Foster a respected, adequately resourced Administration, including Community Standards, Police and Fire Services, that delivers world‐class service to Calgarians</p><p>∙  Assist in establishing unprecedented nation‐to‐nation relations with members of the First Nations, Metis and Inuit communities</p><p>∙  Champion diversity of City committees, boards and Council so they are reflective of the populations they represent</p>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QxQcw_1too,"<p>I was really fortunate that I spent most of my childhood in what is now Ward 11, I’m intimately connected to the communities in Ward 11, and it is where my husband Steve and I are raising our two young daughters. It is the only place in this city where it felt right to run for City Council.</p><p>As your Councillor, I bring expertise in policy, systems change, community development, and sustainability.</p><p>After earning a degree in International Development (Politics and Public Administration) from the University of Guelph, I returned to Calgary where I worked in Human Resources and Employee Relations at Shaw Communications.</p><p>For the last 7 years, I’ve been working for Vibrant Communities Calgary, a local non‐profit organization that works to reduce poverty in Calgary.  In this role, I built productive relationships with businesses, non‐profit organizations, municipal and provincial government, and community volunteers.</p><p>I am an effective and inclusive collaborator who is not afraid to roll up her sleeves and get the job done.</p><p>Let’s see what’s possible with a balanced, moderate perspective at City Hall.</p><p>In my spare time, you can find my family and I taking a walk through the Weaselhead, greeting dogs at the dog park, going for a paddle on the reservoir, or hanging out at the Heritage Park bakery.</p>",https://www.facebook.com/JanetEremenko/,,,http://twitter.com/janeteremenko,,403-370-7746,info@janeteremenko.ca,http://www.janeteremenko.ca/

Good government should know when to serve, and when to get out of the way. Jeromy will champion a smaller and more focused City Hall that puts the needs of everyday Calgarians – and not the elites and special interests – first. Jeromy strongly believes that it’s time to end the culture of entitlement and secrecy that has taken hold of City Hall.</p><p>He’s closely tracked the City of Calgary’s successes and failures, and broken national stories such as Council’s time spent in secret, their lavish perks, and overall attendance. He has spent the last two years asking Calgarians what they need from their municipal representative and will continue to be as available for the residents he seeks to represent.</p><p>From burdensome regulations and business taxes that put Calgary small businesses at a competitive disadvantage when compared to other jurisdictions, to massive property tax hikes that have priced seniors out of their real estate, City Hall is hurting families when they can least afford it. With a transparent and accountable City Hall that once again serves Calgarian families and entrepreneurs, Calgary will retake its place as an economic engine of Canada.</p><p>Calgarians are the most innovative and creative people on the planet, and our entrepreneurs reflect this same spirit of ingenuity. What they need is a willing partner at City Hall who will stand up for those who work hard and pay their taxes, and make Calgary the best place to do business not just in Alberta, but in North America.</p><p>He believes Calgary is the best city to live and work in in this country, and he hopes to serve its residents to keep it that way.</p>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McMy6rmTjro,"<p>Jeromy Farkas is part of a new generation of leadership: fiscally conservative and socially live-and-let-live. He lives in Palliser and is supported by a young, grassroots team of volunteers who are focused on restoring Calgary’s economic opportunity. Jeromy's attention is on responsible spending, lower taxes through innovation, reducing regulations for entrepreneurs, and ending the culture of entitlement and secrecy that has taken hold of City Hall.</p><p>As a born and raised Calgarian, Jeromy is most grateful for the warm welcome Canada gave his family after escaping Communist Hungary in 1956. He comes from a family of entrepreneurs and teachers with deep roots in Southwest Calgary. His grandfather taught music and math for many years in Haysboro.</p><p>Jeromy served at the University of Calgary for eight years and ran the Israel Studies Program. Building on his experience as a Research Team Lead in Medicine, Jeromy developed his own successful small business focused on finance and data analysis.</p><p>Jeromy attended Bishop Carroll High School and holds a bachelor’s degree in Political Science from the University of Calgary. He serves on the executive of the Palliser, Bayview, and Pump Hill Community Association, and as a director on the board of the Weaselhead Preservation Society. Jeromy also commits time as a mentor to students through Mount Royal University.</p>",http://www.facebook.com/JeromyYYC/,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/jeromy-farkas-b25ab1102/,http://twitter.com/JeromyYYC,,403-975-5445,jeromy@jeromy.ca,http://www.jeromy.ca/

It’s important that we have advocates for issues, but also that we all get the chance to contribute.</p><p>Problem Solver - It’s crucial that we find the root cause of an issue and quit working on symptoms. We need well moderated decisions so we can move forward in a direction that benefits everyone affected.</p><p>Collaborative - Calgary and its City Hall has a very diverse set of strengths. No one person, group or department has all the answers, but many have strength in a particular realm. Being able to pull together strengths leads to better, more cohesive outcomes.</p><p>Value - We need to see the value at City Hall. Creating better interaction with citizens and increased awareness of City strengths, along with increased communication, will help us be more confident stakeholders of City Hall.</p><p>My take on some issues facing Calgarians today.</p><p>1. Residential street safety/livability - In a number of places in our older Ward 11 communities, it is very easy for the car to be a nuisance (and a hazard) to the people in their homes. We need to place more emphasis on the livability of the residents.</p><p>2. Seniors Issues - Today’s Calgary evolved from extreme rapid growth and wasn’t planned for a balanced demographic. Our senior population continues to grow and we need to consider all generations in future plans.</p><p>3. Secondary suites – Secondary suites is more than just a rezoning conversation, we can diminish poorly-executed suites with a solid licensing process that includes the home owner and neighbours.</p><p>Note: If it's your kids, your parents or a renter - suite or no - it needs to be safe.</p><p>4. Transit - We need more mobility options in Calgary, and transit is a good way to achieve that, but we need to be smart about its placement, for catchment and possible evolution (LRT possibilities).</p><p>5. Bike Infrastructure – I believe in giving people a chance to make healthy mobility choices. Riding a bike in Calgary can be risky, we need to be sure that making healthy choices isn’t life threatening.</p><p>What does this mean for Ward 11?</p><p>More livable, safer streets: Everyone should be safe and secure no matter how they get around, be it walking, driving, cycling or taking transit.</p><p>We need to keep working on making this a city for everyone - not just the young, healthy and wealthy. Development is coming to Ward 11 and it needs to be sensitive with appropriate conversations of what’s to come.</p><p>Better communication, better listening: We’ve been shut out of too much of what’s happening at City Hall. I’ll work at ensuring you have a conduit for what’s going on and I’ll be your voice to have your opinion heard.</p><p>GET OUT TO VOTE!</p>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK0PNkjJWR4,"<p>Keith Simmons is a born and raised Calgarian, father of three, raising a family in Acadia.</p><p>Keith has been president of the Acadia Community Association for the past two terms, a position that evolved from dealing with issues of road safety and livability years ago. That crusade and his passion for community drives Keith’s desire to ensure that everyone – from children to seniors – have a place in this Ward. Keith has been voluntarily serving Acadia for about a decade.</p><p>Physical activity and sport are important to Keith, from representing Canada in international completion, to officiating in the ‘88 Olympic Games. Keith coached Canada’s Natural Luge Team and was elected Expert to the International Luge Federation. This ethic continues today with interactions in organizations that endeavour to promote active and healthy lives. You’ll often hear Keith say: “we all need to process more oxygen.”</p><p>Self-employed as a fabricator since 2000, Keith supplies designers and engineers with practical, cost-effective solutions. Having come from the production floor, previous work experience includes Quality Assurance implementation and Enterprise Resource Planning implementation.</p><p>Keith sees potential for increased fairness and equitable interactions between the City of Calgary and its citizens. He believes everyone has a voice and, too often, these voices aren’t being listened to. His passion and dedication to community, equity, and collaboration will continue as councillor of Ward 11.</p>",https://www.facebook.com/SimmonsWard11,,,https://twitter.com/_keithsimmons,,403-862-1589,keithsimmons@worksforcalgary.ca,http://www.worksforcalgary.ca/

If we want to build a Calgary that is for everyone, that means making investments in the quadrants of the city that need them the most. Southeast Calgary is the fastest growing area in the city and we need investments to match that growth.</p><p>My commitment to improve Ward 12 is to secure funding for the infrastructure investments our communities need and continue to offer residents the best possible value for their tax dollars. I hope to accomplish this by:</p><p>-          Identifying strategic ways to engage with Calgarians to increase citizen involvement in local government.</p><p>-          Striving to build consensus on Council to make meaningful progress on the things that matter to Calgarians.</p><p>-          Bringing much needed recreational infrastructure to southeast Calgary.</p><p>-          Addressing growing transportation concerns facing Calgary’s fastest growing quadrant.</p><p>-          Encouraging responsible development in southeast Calgary.</p><p>During my election campaigns in 2010 and 2013 residents told me that they desperately needed to see a plan to bring the LRT to southeast Calgary. Over the last 7 years I have been a tireless advocate for the Green Line LRT, Calgary’s largest ever investment in rapid transit. During the 2013 campaign I pledged to secure funding and financing for the project. In the last four years alone I have played a key role in securing $4.65 billion in funding from three orders of government. These funds will allow for the construction of Stage 1 of the Green Line from 16th Ave N to 126th Ave SE. Construction will begin in 2019/2020 and Stage 1 will open for operation in 2026.</p><p>But we aren't finished yet. Over the next four years I pledge to work with the project team to find efficiencies within the procurement process of Stage 1 to extend construction to the McKenzie Towne Station. I also pledge to work with my colleagues on Council to identify future stages of the Green Line LRT and secure funding from The City of Calgary, The Government of Alberta and The Government of Canada. Residents of southeast Calgary know that we have more work ahead of us, and I hope they believe in me to deliver the rest of this project.</p><p>On October 16, 2017, I hope I can count on your vote to continue being your strong advocate for Ward 12.</p>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeGNK5YwWbg,"<p>Greetings! My name is Shane Keating. It has been my privilege to represent the good people of Ward 12 since 2010. Prior to serving on Council I was an accomplished educator and administrator for 31 years. I am married with 6 grown children and 10 grandchildren and have lived in south east Calgary since 1997. I love this area and I want to make sure it continues being an ideal place for you and your family. I have proven myself as someone prepared to work hard and deliver results for the communities of Ward 12. Together we have made some tremendous accomplishments, most notably securing $4.65 billion in funding for Stage 1 of the Green Line LRT. Together we can extend the line further and bring it directly into the communities that desperately need better transportation options.

I am Teresa Hargreaves.  I was born and raised in this dynamic city we all call home.  I have been a resident within Ward 12, for over 21 years and have experienced the explosion and growth within our unique footprint.</p><p>With our ever changing boundaries, growth, development and expansion has led to many different requirements that need to be addressed.  Within my career I have developed excellent communication and organizational skills.  As an oil and gas Landman, I act as a liaison between oil and gas companies and landowners to negotiate and achieve practical solutions, resulting in land asset acquisition and management.   These abilities are a definite asset in accomplishing any concerns we may face.</p><p>Issues I have discovered are currently, that we do not have a police department east of the river.  Due to the economy, crime has increased and has put additional strain on our system.  This is a vital part of our community safety.  A low cost solution is the utilization of existing facilities, to accommodate small detachments.</p><p>The LRT greenline plans are already in place, so now we need to be proactive instead of reactive regarding potential problems this may bring.</p><p>As part of my profession I am involved with orphan wells.  These are wells, and facilities, that no longer have a company operating them.  These wells impose a potential environmental risk, health and safety concerns.  One of the risks are pipelines that are no longer being operated and the Orphan Well Association does not have these lines scheduled for decommission, within their current mandate.  Considering some of these pose an environmental hazard our current safety plans may not include shelter in place, as evacuation may not be an option.  We need to start dialogues, education and training and work towards keeping our residents safe, with shelter in place programs.</p><p>Within the City of Calgary and close proximity to rural areas our first responders will be our front line.  We need to ensure that proper emergency response mechanisms are part of the training and City procedures.</p><p>As a business owner managing finances are part of my success. I would like to take these abilities to better manage City finances and budgeting, working for a better today and future for our citizens.</p><p>I am a passionate hard working person who will definitely address matters, that may arise within our Ward and look for solutions to resolve them.</p><p>It is time, we Ward 12, get heard and action to be taken. I feel it is critical to know what is on your mind.</p><p>Please visit my website and take the on‐line survey. These questions are what constituents have already expressed.  Send me an email to address your concerns and they too will be added to the survey.  Utilizing these results to gather information, to narrow down top priorities, showing me what direction to take, once elected.</p><p>Thank you in advance for your time and attention and I look forward to working with you.</p>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnrae5ZU4Fo,"<p>Welcome to Ward 12,</p><p>I am Teresa Hargreaves. I was born and raised in the City of Calgary and have resided in Ward 12 for over 21 years, where I live with my husband, son and dog.</p><p>As President of LandWorks Resource Management Inc., based in Calgary, we specialize in full brokerage services work such as Mineral/Freehold Land Sales and Surface Acquisitions. We further offer a wide variety of knowledge ranging from the management of oil &amp; gas agreements and assets such as mineral, contract and surface related documents. Our firm prepares and manages oil &amp; gas related agreements and various utilities for governmental bodies.</p><p>Over twenty five years of oil and gas industry experience has taught me to be a great listener, negotiator and problem solver.  Prior to LandWorks Resource Management Inc., I was employed by various oil and gas companies, brokerages and as an instructor with Mount Royal University.</p><p>A foundational belief in professional, academic ans personal ethics has grounded my life and has been an integral part in the success of my personal business.  One of my greatest accomplishments is that I am one of the first members of the Canadian Petroleum Landman Association to complete both accreditation’s, as a professional Landman.</p><p>Outside of my career, I have volunteered and supported Scouts Canada, our local hockey club, Hockey Calgary, Community Programs, Alberta Baton Twirling Association and a season ticket holder with the Calgary Hitmen.</p>",https://www.facebook.com/teresa.forward.775,,,https://twitter.com/teresahward12,https://youtube.com/channel/UC1rAxDl9-UvglhQuO8V3i_w,403-660-1720,theworkscorp2@gmail.com,http://www.teresaforward12.ca/

Global warming, the economy, terrorism, our 2013 flood, the Fort McMurray fire, smoke from BC forest fires, the list goes on.  As a natural and trained leader, I will make a positive contribution to my community and the city I call home.</p><p>I have concerns for the world my daughter and the next generation will inherit.  We must utilize technology, innovation and investment to build Calgary into a city of the future, one that serves as an example to municipalities the world over in pursuit of sustainability, cost efficiency and good governance.</p><p>I have an extraordinarily optimistic view of the world, blessed with the opportunities that growing up in Calgary has enabled.  Humanity has shown me beauty that transcends religion, nationality or creed.  People are intrinsically good and we are all in this life together, I am an ally and friend to all communities.</p><p>As the voice of Ward 13, I will represent our neighbours by:</p><p>•	Partnership and relationship building – with citizens, fellow councillors, community centres, other municipalities and levels of government, the Tsuu T’ina and the media.</p><p>•	Ensuring good governance and corporate fiscal responsibility.</p><p>•	Support and advocate for our communities through Parks, Recreation and Transit facilities.</p><p>Visit www.voteadamb.com for more details and other exciting ideas including challenges to fellow councillors.</p><p>Given the current economic uncertainty it would be irresponsible to advocate for substantial changes, preferring instead for an evolution to current services rather than revolution.  I want to make small affordable tweaks that provide substantial value to the citizens of Ward 13 and Calgary.  We’re doing a great job already, but must remain diligent in consistently improving city services and infrastructure.</p><p>The immediate future will place many challenges on Council, there are important decisions that will be made.  Decisions on a potential Olympic bid could mean infrastructure investments in a new arena, Ctrain expansion to the airport, and retrofitting to existing winter athletic facilities.  Marijuana legalization, the fentanyl crisis, secondary suites, and economic challenges will all also take analysis and decisive action.</p><p>The role of municipal government is service provision and is more important to the daily lives of citizens than any other level of government.  When you call 911 help is sent, when you turn your taps water pours out, and when you need to relax we have world class parks and recreation facilities.  We have to be focused and determined to leave our city better today, to ensure a prosperous and healthy tomorrow for future generations.

My platform is, in part:</p><p>Open Access to your Councillor</p><p>I will hold scheduled and regular conversations with the residents of Ward 13 every quarter (Jan, April, July and October) to listen to your concerns, ideas and feedback.   I will then work towards providing answers to you as quickly as possible.  You may not always get the answer you want, but you will be heard and you will get an answer.  Our Ward deserves and is entitled to have a City Councillor who will take your concerns seriously.</p><p>Only having a 'report card' every four years near an election, as is the current case, doesn't serve the communities well and needs to change.</p><p>Your Taxes and Tax Room</p><p>I am committed to keeping taxes to a minimum by looking at how we are currently utilizing the tax dollars you already give to the city.</p><p>Budgets need to be reviewed to ensure the NEEDS of the various departments are met to provide the best possible service to everyone without unnecessary WANTS increasing the bottom line.  Have a regular review of current policies and streamlining them if they don’t make sense.</p><p>The practice of Council and your current Councillor voting in favour of arbitrarily keeping Tax Room that the Province gives back to you equates to an automatic and permanent tax increase that you have no say in.  The Tax Room is money the Province doesn’t need and is intended to go back to YOU:  No debates, No Exceptions, GIVE IT BACK!</p><p>The Secondary Suites issue must be dealt with once and for all.   With good business rules in place, most applications can be dealt with by City Administration.  Only the most exceptional cases should be brought forward for Council to consider.   All new communities should be developed in a way that would allow for legal secondary suites.</p><p>Winter Olympic bid should not go ahead based on the current cost projections.   The amount of money earmarked for security is only about half of what it would actually cost and therefore the bid projection is not reliable.   More work would need to be done on the cost projection before I could see myself supporting it.</p><p>For information on other issues visit my website:  <a target=""_blank"" href=""www.adamwfrisch.info"">www.adamwfrisch.info</a> Campaign paid for entirely by Adam W Frisch</p>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqfUCfu3MuI,"<p>•	Adam Frisch lives in Ward 13‐Evergreen since 2004;</p><p>•	President ‐ Calgary Evergreen Community Association;</p><p>•	President ‐ Stonecroft Evergreen Condo Board;</p><p>•	Director ‐ CardelRec South Board of Directors;</p><p>•	Trico Centre Board of Directors;</p><p>•	Veteran of the Canadian Armed Forces (Sergeant); and</p><p>•	Creator and Co‐Founder ‐ Never Give Up (Family violence website)  <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.never‐give‐up.com"">www.never‐give‐up.com</a></p><p>Adam currently works in Robotic Process Automation, where, as a RPA Specialist, he configures and trains software robots, as well as being the Quality Manager.</p><p>Adam previously worked as a Transformation Coach for 10 years within Operations Management, coaching managers and executives globally how to improve the performance and productivity of their workforce.</p><p>As President of Calgary Evergreen Community Association (CECA), Adam works at strengthening the Board and looks to build a stronger Ward 13 through collaboration with other community associations.</p><p>As President of the Stonecroft Evergreen Condo Board for the past 10 years, Adam has, through effective leadership, fiscal responsibility and accountability, maintained the property and investments of the owners.</p><p>Adam became the Creator and Co‐founder of Never Give Up after the murder of his sister, Karen Beck in 2007.

Taxes are continually increasing at every level of government, and taxpayers aren’t seeing a return on their investment. It’s time for a common sense approach. We need to elect a city council in October that will cut wasteful spending and respect taxpayers’ hard-earned dollars.</p><p>Kickstart the local economy</p><p>Calgary has been hit hard in recent years. Too many Calgarians are out of work, and the current council has not made their lives easier. Red tape and bureaucracy has slowed recovery and gotten in the way of job creation at the  very worst time. I will champion measures to reduce the administrative burden and cut unnecessary regulations.</p><p>Safe communities</p><p>As a former Calgary police officer, I know all too well the toll that crime can take on a community. I am particularly concerned with the ongoing fentanyl crisis in our city. I will support measures to get these drugs off of our streets and ensure first responders have the tools they need to protect the community and make it home safely to their families at the end of the day.</p><p>Public art</p><p>I believe public art is valuable to the community and should be encouraged. However, the current policy is clearly not working. Public art should be accessible to the community, not jammed into a corner of a highway interchange. Public art should also come at a reasonable cost to taxpayers, with more meaningful consultations with community members.</p><p>Calgary Olympic Bid</p><p>Those of us who remember the 1988 Olympics know the community spirit and pride that Calgarians felt about hosting the Games in our own backyard. With council currently considering a bid for 2026, I believe Calgary could support a bid for the Games, in partnership with Edmonton, to keep costs down.</p><p>Sports Facilities</p><p>While I support the development of a new arena to meet the needs of Calgarians, the Flames organization will need to be creative in raising funds. I am supportive of their endeavours to do so, but not at the expense of taxpayers.</p><p>Transparency</p><p>I believe elected officials should be accountable and transparent to the citizens they serve. It is unacceptable to me that Calgary’s city council leads the country in time spent “in-camera” and hidden away from public scrutiny. As councillor, I will support measures to limit in-camera sessions as much as possible.</p><p>Term Limits</p><p>I don’t believe that Calgarians are well served by lifetime politicians who remain in their positions for decades at a time. City council needs fresh ideas and councillors who are engaged with their communities. I would commit to bringing forward a proposal to implement term limits if elected.</p>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSshOuSGsLE,"<p>Art has spent a lifetime in public service.

Return money directly back to you that the Province doesn’t take.</p><p>•	Continue to reduce operating costs and increase efficiencies. Be a leader in keeping taxes low while delivering needed programs and services we are responsible for.  Partner with the private sector.</p><p>•	Demonstrate accountability, transparency and tax value to citizens for the services delivered.</p><p>•	My Motion to freeze Management salaries and bonuses was adopted by Council in 2016.  This needs to continue.</p><p>•	My motion to bring in a Sunshine List for full disclosure of City staff salaries, benefits and perks was adopted by Council. More transparency and detail is needed.</p><p>•	Don’t support the proposed City Charter that would allow the City to run annual operating deficits.</p><p>•	Freeze the Public Art Program and have the private sector pay (not taxpayers) as part of being awarded infrastructure projects.</p><p>NEIGHBOURHOOD SAFETY &amp; SECURITY</p><p>•	With speeding, social disorder and theft as the main issues for residents in Ward 13, we must continue to increase the number of frontline Police Officers to strengthen community-based policing. Add more Transit Police to the LRT system.</p><p>•	Hold property owners accountable for their derelict problem properties that degrade a neighbourhood.  Bring owners before the Coordinated Safety Response Team (CSRT) to address citizen concerns in a timely manner.  Have City staff use approved tools like remedial orders, violation tickets and court injunctions for compliance.</p><p>ROADS, TRANSIT &amp; MANAGING CONGESTION</p><p>•	As in other cities, pilot a new “Safety School Zone Plan” through the Innovation Fund that would include engaging with families to identify “watch your speed” driver feedback signs, flashing beacons on school zone signs, and more school zone stencils on pavement which would extend up to 250 metres away from the designated schools to encourage children to walk or bike and feel safe.</p><p>•	STOP the SWBRT expansion going past Rockyview Hospital with a newly elected Council.  The need for this Bus Rapid Transit is not justified to go into Woodbine.  Wait until the new community of Providence is built out over the next 10 years.</p><p>COMMUNITY QUALITY OF LIFE</p><p>•	Increase the number of soccer, hockey, tennis courts, baseball fields, skateboard parks and tot lots, along with more community programming.</p><p>•	With 150 off-leash dog parks in Calgary, we need more in Ward 13. Finalize the addition of three new off-leash dog parks in Providence, along the 37th Street SW Corridor, and at the former park north of the community of Silverado.</p><p>•	Eliminate dandelions in public areas by increasing weed control and mowing practices.</p><p>•	Launch Citizen Juries to genuinely engage residents on any topic, issue or policy (unlike the SWBRT process and using 4-minute opinion phone polls).</p>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ir5xTU2yPFU,"<p>Diane has served as Ward 13 Councillor, a City-wide Official and Deputy Mayor for 17 years.

Departments MUST look at what is needed to provide services to prevent bureaucratic growth.</p><p>•	Front line service providers are not the enemy. They have even been discouraged by their managers for their suggestions on improving the services they deliver.

Zero-based budgeting is just one tool I will use to move this forward.</p><p>TERM LIMITS – I believe that council chambers must be kept vibrant and open-minded with a constant flow of new ideas for council members to give scrutiny to.

These contracts will be made public.</p><p>•	Preference to Local Businesses – Where bids are close to equivalent, contracts will be awarded to local contractors.</p><p>•	City Council Represents Calgarians – Private meetings of City Council must be minimized.</p><p>REVIEW OF MUNICIPAL OPERATIONS – Calgary needs to operate efficiently, projects be completed on time and on budget, unnecessary projects eliminated, capital expenditures brought under control, and waste of taxpayer’s money must be curtailed.</p><p>ELIMINATE BUREAUCRATIC RED TAPE – Currently it can take 11 months or more for construction and other private sector projects to be approved. New businesses are waiting months to open their doors, creating new jobs, because permits to operate take forever to be issued. This is counterproductive to growth and economic success.

City council has approved near annual tax increases, which have been particularly troubling for local businesses trying to make ends meet, which have left Calgarians feeling the pinch. We’ve all had to wait until 2017 to enjoy tax stability due to a large depletion of our reserve fund. The City of Calgary must realize that during a recession, Calgarians do not have the ability to pay for annual tax increases. Large increases for businesses operating in the suburbs are forcing some over the edge. I’ll work for tax stability at City Hall to get us off the cycle of annual increases which are unsustainable by focusing spending on high quality essential services. The City needs to budget and spend carefully and avoid niche projects and interests which it cannot afford.</p><p>TRANSPORTATION</p><p>The daily commute is a reality for most residents of Ward 13. The City of Calgary needs to ensure adequate planning for our future transportation needs by improving public transportation and road planning. Our communities can be made more walkable and safe through a more proactive assessment of the needs of the community and the increased use of cross walks and lights. We also need to keep Calgary moving through an improved snow removal plan in the winter months.</p><p>CONSULTATION</p><p>Residents deserve to be consulted in a meaningful way about developments that will impact their community. The City of Calgary must take public input into consideration before a project is approved, not afterwards. Community support should be a key element for a project to move forward and opposition must be reflected in future decisions. We also need a member of council who’s meeting with the community on a regular basis.</p><p>FAIR ENTRY</p><p>We need to ensure that the Fair Entry program continues so that everyone can participate fully in the life of the City. Currently, some of our seniors are being left out by the way their income is calculated. The Fair Entry program must assess an individual’s income in the case of seniors.</p><p>COMMUNITY CENTRES</p><p>Far too many communities in Ward 13 do not have a community centre and nothing has been done to remedy the situation in the last 17 years. Community centres serve as important hubs for clubs, children, seniors and adults to gather for active living and public engagement. We need a member of council who will work with the City of Calgary and business to build community centres in Ward 13.</p><p>I believe in the value of volunteerism and in engaging all of our citizens in the life of the City of Calgary. I’m running to be your proactive and accessible Councillor for Ward 13.

If elected, my goal will be to make sure it stays that way by keeping City Hall out of your wallet, and making sure the money it does take goes to benefit Ward 14. I will remember my small business roots, and the pain of sending my hard earned money to the government. I will never forget that you‐‐the taxpayer‐‐are my boss.</p><p>I will continue to search for every efficiency, and cost‐cutting measure within the City’s budget, and I will not support any budget that does not strive for savings. Zero‐based reviews and the “Cut the Red Tape” Committee‐‐both of which I have been heavily involved in‐‐have each already saved tens of millions, and my budget savings account has saved over $100 million, and counting. Public art is a want, not a need which is why I proposed to cut it. There are many ways that I have saved money, but there are many more that we need to find.

I try to poll my constituents whenever possible, and make a point to knock on doors regularly. I will never stop seeking out the out the opinions of my constituents, and I will never hide behind the walls of City Hall. I urge you to visit www.peterdemong.ca/your‐community, and www.peterdemong.ca/your‐voice for examples of how I am making Ward 14, and its people, my top priority.</p><p>When I was first elected in 2010 I ran as a business owner fed up with City Hall, its endless tax increases, and lack of accountability. Since then I have made it my mission to remain true to those roots. If elected, I will continue to do exactly that! I am the employee, you are my employer, and you know best how to spend your own money.</p>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wePL2DqPG5g,"<p>With 18 years as a business owner, and 25 years in the field of Logistics Management under his belt, Peter brings a successful business background to Council, offering the ability to manage budgets and understand the needs of small and large businesses alike.

While progress has been made in each area, I hope to continue this important work with your support.</p><p>Preparing students to succeed</p><p>Over the past four years, trustees have become more data‐focused in order to identify areas of strength and weakness. In response to areas of trustee concern, the CBE has developed system‐wide strategies for literacy, mathematics and indigenous learners. While these strategies are meant to improve results, trustees need to monitor student outcomes in order to ensure gains are being made.</p><p>A lack of schools where students live, as well as ageing inner city facilities, has created many challenges. As a result of persistent advocacy by trustees and community members in the past four years, over 30 new school and modernization projects for the CBE were announced by the province. However, Calgary continues to grow and facilities continue to age, so trustees must continue to advocate to ensure that the province funds new schools and modernizations where they are needed most.</p><p>Building trust</p><p>Due to a lack of consistency with regards to community consultation, the CBE recently developed a new engagement framework. This includes posting all feedback received on the CBE website so that the public has access to the various perspectives shared and how they were incorporated into the final decisions. I still feel that much more work needs to be done to be responsive to the concerns of Calgarians. Trustees need to lead policy discussions and set priorities for the system that reflect the needs of our communities.</p><p>In order to be accountable to the citizens of Calgary, trustees need to communicate through a variety of means and be more forthcoming around decisions being made and the rationale behind them. I will continue to make every effort to accept every invitation to events and meetings, and to be accessible and active on social media in an effort to inform and engage with Calgarians on current issues in education.</p><p>Using financial resources wisely</p><p>There is now more public information available about how the CBE spends $1.4 billion than ever before. While my motion for an independent review of how the CBE allocates resources did not pass, the Minister is conducting a partial review this Fall. Trustees will need to ensure that the results of the review are appropriately considered to ensure efficient spending.</p><p>Despite provincial funding not keeping pace with inflation plus growth, the number of school‐based staff has increased in order to keep up with enrolment growth, while non‐school based staff has not. This school year, funding directly to schools will increase by 1.4% while central service units will be cut by a further 3.7%. Trustee pay has also remained frozen at $45,000 over the past four years. Future provincial budgets will continue to put pressure on CBE finances and trustees need to ensure that the priority is student learning.</p>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyI9Clgtl-g,"<p>I have been proud to serve as a public school trustee over the past four years where I have put my experience in education, research and finance to good use.</p><p>My Bachelor of Science degree taught me how to critically analyze data, allowing me to ask tough questions and to dig deeper into student results and plans for improvement.</p><p>As a teacher in Quebec, Ontario and Taiwan, I learned about different education systems and policies, and the challenges faced by teachers with increasingly diverse and complex classrooms.</p><p>While completing a Masters in Educational Technology, I gained a deeper understanding of current education research and effective teaching practices.</p><p>Working in the financial services industry has given me a strong background in reading financial documents which has been invaluable as trustees are responsible for budgets of over a billion dollars. I am the mother of three children who all attend Calgary Board of Education (CBE) schools. I have been involved in the CBE as a parent, a school council chair and an executive member of the Association for Responsive Trusteeship in Calgary Schools and Save Our Fine Arts. I enjoy volunteering at my children's schools, as the primary pianist in my church, and as a YMCA preschool teacher.</p><p>I believe that there are very few things that matter more than a strong public education system. With your support, I hope to continue this important work for another four years.</p>",https://www.facebook.com/Trina.Hurdman.Trustee,,,https://twitter.com/trinayyc,,403-828-5825,trina@hurdman.ca,http://www.trinahurdman.ca/

This focus means every decision and every dollar supports student success in the classroom. School programming must focus on students' needs today and into the future.</p><p>Our 5 Point Platform</p><p>1. 	Math is broken and our children are not getting the math skills they need to move their education forward.</p><p>a.	CBE’s failure rate for grade 6 is 56% higher than the Catholic Board, and it’s almost as bad for grade 9.</p><p>b.	While some parents can afford tutoring or upgrading, many cannot. Frankly, no one should have to.</p><p>c.	By working with mathematicians we will implement the best methodology to ensure student success.</p><p>2. 	With central administration costs almost double the Catholic Board, we estimate almost $100 million goes into downtown‐related costs that should be going into schools.</p><p>a.	Tough decisions may need to be made and electing a majority of Students Count team members ensures this happens.</p><p>b.	More dollars to schools means more dollars directly benefitting children and their teachers…in the classroom.</p><p>3.	Report cards are an indication of how a child is doing at school.  While not the only feedback, it is a key indicator.  At the junior high level we need to return to percentage grades.</p><p>4.	Student wellness is key to a child’s success.  Under a broad definition of wellness, we want to capture all possible problems in the school.  Whether it is the need for a GSA, a student‐to‐student problem, or a student struggling; an ombudsman position will address unresolved issues and help guide to a healthy resolution.</p><p>5.	In the spring government was asked to prohibit union or corporate donations for trustee elections.  They refused.  Students Count candidates will not accept any dollars from these groups. We don’t believe it is healthy for democracy to have unions and companies you may have to negotiate with, able to give money to candidates.</p><p>We believe if decisions are made with the lens of what is best for students, they will receive the greatest benefits. Our candidates believe in a greater and more meaningful role for parents in the CBE.</p><p>We believe teachers play a key role in the education of children and need to be supported in their profession.</p><p>We believe administration is an important part of the system but must be focused on delivering services to students effectively and efficiently.</p>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyQeqWyP7iE,"<p>Althea Guzman Adams is a native Calgarian who is passionate about education.

Recent conversations about the merits of inquiry-based math show that many students are struggling and their skills are not where they need to be.</p><p>·         It’s time for our public school board to push for the best interests of Calgary families by better preparing children for a successful future.  I will listen to families’ concerns through consultation within the community, and build a strategy to tackle this head-on.</p><p>TRANSPARENCY</p><p>·         What sets me apart from other candidates is that I am a collaborator who works openly and cooperatively with others. As an experienced board member, I will work with other trustees, using democracy and discourse to tackle the issues that arise. I will stand up for my constituents, while supporting my colleagues as they do the same for theirs.</p><p>·        To show my commitment to transparency, I have not accepted any donations from corporations or unions. My campaign was funded by myself, family, friends and individuals who share my vision for public education in Calgary.</p><p>·         As an independent voice for you, I will not allow political influence or back door deals darken the doorway of public school education.

Make Bussing Work: Bianca Smetacek strongly believes that every child should have a safe and affordable means of transportation to school. The Calgary Board of Education (CBE) should not attempt to balance its budget at the cost of children’s safety. If elected, the first issue Bianca will address is bussing.</p><p>2.	Comprehensive Report Cards:  CBE student report cards should reflect a child’s academic progress. Bianca will work with the CBE to develop an evaluation and reporting process that is useful for students and parents: report cards with more detail, more frequent analysis, and constructive feedback for both students and parents. Bianca will work to develop and put in place a more consistent, understandable, personalized, accurate, and robust academic reporting system.</p><p>3.	Fix Math: In the past two months Bianca has personally met and interacted with thousands of parents in Wards 5 and 10. One major concern that has featured consistently in the conversation is math literacy. It is also reported, by the Kids Come First organization, that the math results in North East Calgary schools are particularly troubling, with 93 per cent of schools falling below the provincial average in math. This is unacceptable to Bianca and she will work with the CBE to address this problem with urgency. A good first step will be to invite experts from post-secondary institutions around the province, to provide recommendations on how to improve math scores. Bianca will work diligently to eliminate the disparity and underperformance in math that currently exists among the public school students of Wards 5 and10.</p><p>4.	English Language Learning: Bianca will encourage the CBE to invest in early support for English language learners, so that students can flourish academically in all subjects.</p><p>5.	Funding for Classrooms: Education is the foundation of modern society and the engine of our economy. Quality education is necessary to promote multicultural harmony and ensure our overall wellbeing.

Improving student achievement through community engagement is a key focus of School Trustee. I intend on being a representative for constituents in ensuring that the values, priorities and expectations of the community are reflected in policies of school governance, so that students may reach their fullest potential. My focus as a School Trustee will be on student priorities and educational needs allowing our students to reach their fullest potential while engaging the public's input for their core values, priorities, and expectations.

Supporting Families in Every Way Possible</p><p>This includes listening to parent’s concerns in regard to the challenges that they face whether that be bussing, program options, or student safety. Using the feedback from parents to draft and implement suggestions, strategies or guidelines that can be given to appropriate parties (government, teachers, superintendent, etc). I would also serve you by having flexible office hours and implementing different communication tools such as video chat, so parents don’t have to go out of their way to talk to me.</p><p>2. Ensuring Calgary Students are Globally Competitive</p><p>Advocating for strong “soft skills” / workforce skills and 'hard skills' / technology skills. I would also be advocating for trades, specialization and life skills in school and supporting children who may not want to go to post secondary.</p><p>I would also advocate for providing essential life skills learning for high school children. Including, but not limited to resume and letter writing, understanding debt (credit cards, car loans, mortgages), and super basic life skills like creating a disaster plan, sewing a button and other simple things that seem to have been lost along the way.</p><p>3. Modernize The Way We Operate</p><p>This includes implementing cost saving measures that are more efficient and more effective. and ensuring our technology is user friendly and easy to navigate.

The time that Marilyn has invested volunteering in public schools has allowed her to see first‐hand the great work being done in our public schools and identify the areas where our students and educators need more support.  Marilyn understands that changes are necessary to ensure that the students in NE Calgary have access to resources and experiences that will allow them to achieve academic results that are comparable to those in other areas of the CBE.</p><p>Marilyn has been listening to parents and invested community members in Wards 5 &amp; 10 and has identified the following areas of concern:</p><p>SUPPORT ‐ Support for students, schools and educators needs to increase as complexity in the classroom continues to grow.  Students need to be supported in a way that will help them reach their maximum potential.  Schools and educators need to have resources so they can provide a learning environment that is conducive to meeting the vast needs of their students.</p><p>EQUALITY ‐ Reporting indicates that academic results are not consistent across all Calgary Board of Education schools.  As the entity providing public education in Calgary, the CBE needs to work toward ensuring that resources, experiences and advantages are available to all students across the system no matter where they live or what school they attend, so that their learning outcomes are comparable.</p><p>ADVOCACY ‐ Wards 5 &amp; 10 need a strong advocate who understands the challenges faced by schools in these Wards and someone who can clearly articulate those challenges and facilitate discussion on solutions with the Board of Trustees, CBE administration, the Province and other stakeholders.</p><p>As a Trustee, Marilyn’s greatest partners will be you – the parents and community members who are passionate about public education.

Calgarians have clearly articulated what they expect from their public education system and we need to work together to ensure adequate funding to support those expectations. Education should not be a political issue but one of social responsibility and I appreciate the non-partisan nature of the role of trustee.  What we invest in our children today will benefit everyone tomorrow.</p><p>I am here for kids.  I do not have a hidden agenda or other political aspirations and this is not a stepping stone to something else.  I believe in the people that live and work in the Northeast and I know first-hand that the challenges and opportunities in this area are different than in other parts of Calgary. Our kids’ future should not be defined by the perceived reputation of a school, community or quadrant of the City – there is tremendous pride in the Northeast! Our kids are more than just test scores and data points.  Each child is unique, has different learning needs, and requires differing levels of support to ensure their success. Our mandate is K-12 education and while expectations are high and there are competing values at play and demands on limited resources for additional services that are provided; we must ensure that educating kids is the first priority.</p><p>I support enhanced learning opportunities that fall outside of what is now considered a basic education and help to leverage each student’s ability to achieve success, find their passion and reach their potential. The more opportunities and experiences available to students to explore what they are passionate about, where their interests lie, and what challenges they want to solve the better their chance of success in life.</p><p>Trustees are elected to govern the school system and individual trustees have no authority over the organization. While it is the Board as a whole that determines the direction and priorities for the entire organization I remain committed to ensuring that my Board colleagues, Administration, MLA’s, and Government understand the challenges and opportunities for families in Wards 5 and 10. I continue to advocate for cross ministerial support for education to ensure resources are available to meet the diverse needs of our students. I remain committed to working with government to ensure that the Calgary context is reflected in decisions being made for Alberta students.  There are significant changes to legislation in the works as the Municipal Election is underway – the work does not stop.  Regardless of the outcome of the election for current trustees there will be a minimum of four new members on the Board and that is significant.  My experience will provide some continuity and assist new colleagues in getting up to speed on significant Provincial initiatives currently in the works.</p><p>I appreciate your continued support!</p>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eztiv2nJ4JU,"<p>It is an honour and a privilege to be serving my third term as your trustee in Wards 5 and 10 and I look forward to your continued support.</p><p>Born and raised in Calgary, CBE Alumni, a single mother of two, a grandmother and a long-time resident in the community of Forest Heights, I am passionate about people and committed to working together on behalf of students.

Education that uplifts the overall growth of the students for their full potential to bring success.</p><p>• There has to be transparency and accountability for funds being utilized. Public and Parents need to be informed from time to time where the budget is being allocated. This will lead to more caution and appropriate actions that will help, money going towards the students programs. There are always ways of doing things innovatively and allocating the money effectively to school, as every dollar counts when purchases are to be made for the students in the classrooms.</p><p>• There has to be advocacy for productive and effective communication to bridge the gap between the parents and the board. Presently there is a wide gap in communication between the parents and the board. I have seen, especially the parents who have language barriers are hesitant to speak out their problems until they find trust through appropriate language communication. I believe education sets the standards where students go in life.</p><p>• A safe school environment for students should be a high priority. Parents are not happy to see their kids as young as 10 years taking transit and walk to bus stops, as they are terrified of growing traffic in the neighbourhoods. Neither they are happy when students have to go to nearby recreational facilities for gym and sports purposes. Unfortunately students are left with no choice to leave the premises frequently. So infrastructure that caters to appropriate needs is important. Planning of safety polices have to be collaborative both by the parents and the schools.</p><p>• Development of relevant and sustainable education programs that build a strong foundation is important so that students get the right skills. Programs for wellness that expand their minds and learn about themselves and others. Math scores can be increased if the students have a strong foundation. Usually it is a subject which is neglected at the elementary level, which has resulted in lower math scores in the past years. Math scores can be increased if the students have a strong foundation in beginning math. Usually it is a subject neglected at the elementary level that has resulted in lower math scores in the past years. More funds are required for the ESL programs so that those students facing the problem become more appropriately communicative.</p><p>• Value for inclusivity of students is important so that there is equal environment for all the students. Inclusiveness leads to open mindedness and freedom to accept the peers in the school environment. When inclusivity in schools is emphasised students don’t feel left out, their learning styles are more attended and their potentials maximized. It builds a learning community where students trust each other.</p><p>403-585-9675 | electdrgill@gmail.com | Facebook page- Raman Gill Candidate for Public School Board Trustee I twitter- Ramanthoughts</p>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_phOfoGeQE,"<p>Raman Gill has experience in Post-Secondary Education, Adult Learning and Youth programs.

The findings of the Education Ministry’s operational review of CBE will help find solutions for imminent concerns including the major transportation woes.  Clear expectations set for the school board by the board of trustees will ensure efficacy through monitoring of actual performance against expectations. The provincial government decides the allocation of funds to the boards, however proper apportionments within the board can still be ensured.</p><p>Student and Educator Voice</p><p>Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs states that before students can meet their full potential, their basic needs of Safety, Belongingness, and Self Esteem ought to be met.

A harmonious working environment is essential to cater for their intellectual growth and overall success in the real world.</p><p>Optimal Use of Resources</p><p>Appropriate use of taxpayers’ money and getting full value of the dollar is vital especially in the current economic situation of Calgary. More than half of Calgary’s taxpayers do not have children in schools and we need to ensure that their tax dollars are put to proper use. Calgary has experienced exponential growth in the past two decades, which adds further pressure on the resources of the education boards and more responsibility on the board of trustees to ensure the best use of resources.</p><p>As a trustee, it is critical that Calgary Board of Education’s existing buildings and facilities are utilized optimally. Advocating for proper provisions of new schools is required to cater to students in growing communities. At the same time, continual modernization and upgrading of existing facilities will keep them in a working condition to meet the growing number of school age children in the city.</p><p>Community Connections</p><p>Rekha believes in investing in strong community connections where the voices of taxpayers are routinely funnelled into the board. Rekha’s understanding of the community’s voice from teaching in both ward 5 and 10 for 14 years allows her to help understand and bring forth the community’s suggestions to the school board.

My skills have been polished in the areas of Early Childhood Learning, education and management. The major stakeholders in the school board affairs include, students, parents, teachers, school administrators, city government and the community in general. There needs to be a unity of purpose &amp; vision among all stakeholders, which is presently lacking. The main objective should be the Success and Welfare of students and the schools.</p><p>First, is the issue of Accountability. An Alberta Govt. Accountability Pillar report in May 2017 shows that there are areas of concern in the CBE, particularly FNMI (First Nations, Metis, Inuit) students. These include: High Drop Out rate (FNMI); Significant Drop in the Diploma acceptability rate (All); Not Very High Parental Involvement (All); High transition rate (All); very low diploma participation rate (FNMI). These issues need to be effectively addressed by the Board. The report does not consider fiscal accountability at all.</p><p>Second is the issue of Funding, Budgeting and Fiscal Responsibility. About 92% of the funding comes from the Province. However, the basic funding per student has declined each year since September 2012 from about $ 9600 to anticipated about $ 8800 in 2017-18. I feel that the CBE has not adequately addressed this issue.</p><p>In the area of budgeting, an external auditor’s report best describes the dire state of affairs as “… a theme of frustration with budget to actual reporting”. The report also states that the schools are not taking full advantage of additional funding to procure goods and services.

Every student attending a Calgary Public school deserves the very best education our society can provide.  Parents should feel confident that their children are being provided the opportunity to maximize their full potential for a happy, rewarding and successful life.</p><p>The all‐encompassing role of a school trustee is to ensure the Calgary Public School System fulfills that mandate.  Success is the goal for every student.</p><p>Inevitably a major focus for a trustee is the Board’s relationship with the Alberta Government. This relationship must be based on a solid understanding of the partnership involved.  That partnership must be based on a knowledge of and a respect for the responsibilities of each.  To ensure this mutual respect and understanding MLA’s and trustees must continuously communicate on behalf of their respective and overlapping constituencies.  Should I be fortunate enough to be elected I pledge to make this dialogue on an ongoing element of my service.</p><p>Much of my life has been spent as a student and educator in Alberta’s public education system. As such I am aware that certain issues of concern are perennial and ongoing.  Among them are report cards, student safety, bussing, test scores, fees and curriculum to mention just a few.  Trustees must be aware that regarding these issues better is always possible and that improvement is always an appropriate goal.</p><p>Along with the aforementioned issues I believe the major concerns facing the Calgary Public school system are as follows:</p><p>Sustainable Funding:</p><p>Calgary Public is dependent upon the Alberta Government for its funds.  The economic downturn has exacerbated financial concerns.  Issues such as school fees and bussing are being impacted by the price of oil.  Despite this downturn education must continue to be a priority for Albertans.  A child’s education cannot be put on hold until the price of oil rebounds.</p><p>School Modernization:</p><p>Over 50% of Calgary public schools are over 50 years of age.  They require over $1 billion in modernization improvements and for the most part they were needed yesterday.</p><p>School Construction:</p><p>Calgary continues to grow.  Calgary needs more schools. Calgary needs them now.  Trustees must unite to ensure that children throughout Calgary have easy access to community schools.</p><p>The job of being a school trustee for the second largest school system in Canada is onerous and challenging.  It is also very important.  I believe my experience, enthusiasm and energy will allow me to start immediately to make a positive impact.  For trustee in wards 8 and 9 on October 16 vote for a name you can trust.  Vote for Richard Hehr. www.RichardHehr.ca</p>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V2PZfg7LWw,"<p>Education has been my life’s calling. I have spent 41 years in public education: and thirty of those were with the Calgary Public School System.  I have been involved with classrooms from elementary through senior high, serving as both a teacher and an administrator. I have had extensive involvement with the Alberta Teachers’ Association and served four terms as President of Calgary Public Teachers.</p><p>My commitment to public education is also a family affair. My wife Judy has had a distinguished 30‐year career with the Calgary Public school system and is now retiring as the School Trustee for wards 8 and 9.  Our two children Kent and Kristie are proud graduates of Sir Winston Churchill High School.</p><p>We have three grandchildren presently attending Calgary Public Schools.  Jackson and Parker are at Early Grey School and Marshall is entering the late French Immersion program at Elboya.</p><p>Public service is part of the Hehr family DNA.  My commitment to the Calgary Public School system and the 125,000 students it serves is unwavering.</p><p>I look forward to serving this system once again, this time in the capacity of trustee for wards 8 and 9.</p><p>If you’d like to read more about my vision for public schools, and my campaign, consider going to www.RichardHehr.ca.

We should be creating learning environments where students feel confident and safe. Student mental health and well‐being is a passion of mine and it will continue to be a priority if you re‐elect me as your trustee.</p><p>Far too many of our students experience depression and anxiety. I believe we need to have a system wide engagement on mental health and well being. The CBE has engaged our communities on math, literacy, and transportation. A similar initiative is needed on mental health. By asking questions about the issues affecting student mental health and well‐being, we better understand how to support students and the system.</p><p>I believe the CBE can create even better opportunities to support our students, families and staff, and continue the progress I've seen with Bill 10 and the CBE System‐Wide Code of Conduct. We should share best practices throughout the system and strengthen partnerships with Health Services, Social Services and not‐profit services so all students, teachers and families can easily access resources and support.</p><p>ENGAGED PARENTS</p><p>Working with parents has been a highlight of my work as trustee. Understanding our parents’ perspectives is a critical part of my job, and I have worked hard to build good relationships and partnerships with parents. The CBE Engagement Strategy, which your voice helped us create, has strengthened CBE’s understanding of parent concerns and, in turn, helped us communicate with you.</p><p>Helping parents understand  the role of trustee is also a vital part of my work. In order to support  parents in the system, it helps greatly when parents understand  the roles and responsibilities of a trustee.</p><p>The CBE is a complex, diverse system, and we need to continue to find ways to learn together. Your voice helps me understand the needs of each child, so we can best meet the needs of all children within our school system. If I am re‐elected I will continue to focus on engaging with parents and the community as partners.</p><p>GREAT SCHOOLS</p><p>Every school at the CBE is publicly funded, so advocating for public education is another important part of my job. A strong public education system builds a society of innovative and empathetic critical thinkers.</p><p>A year‐to‐year funding cycle makes managing a large system like the CBE unnecessarily difficult.  The CBE needs predictable, stable three year funding cycle from the government so our staff can adequately meet the needs of our students.</p><p>Public education is a common good. I will work hard to keep that common good at the top of the government’s priority list.</p>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iu9buGywFSU,"<p>Calgary became home turf for Julie when an energy opportunity brought her family here when she was 15.

There are several topics on the top of my list as my main focuses.</p><p>Family Strength/Community Strength - I see families struggling with many issues that are affecting people from having a strong family unit. I would like the public school system to show more initiatives that promote healthy family dynamics and ultimately promote people come together even more during these hard times.</p><p>Hard work, Productivity and Reward: Since the children spend 12 years as full time students and work hard showing up, attending their classes, and since we know they are capable of achieving a very high standard, I would opt the Calgary Board of Education brings back the old grading system so children and parents can see more accurate assessments and reward from their child's hard work.</p><p>Respect: The no bullying initiatives are something all parents can agree with but we are missing something apparently. More and more parents are saying their children are not being respectful and, like I said above, there are a lot of things that influence our day to day lives. The last thing we need is for everyone taking it out on everyone else. I have a Three Strikes you're out model designed and it applies to everyone in the school. I then have a zero tolerance for sexual harassment or assault. We all need to model respect to these children and enforce it.</p><p>Safe and Productive Learning Institutions: With everyone on the same consequences regarding respect I believe incidents in the schools can decrease. Two more things that would help students feel safe and I am prepared for this controversial discussion, are requiring anyone new to Canada is required time to adjust to Canada and learn English before enrolling in the public school system. It is safer for all at the school, mostly mentally, as their needs to be more care taken on the integration. The third thing is I would propose all schools take a look at their emergency plans and protocols and ensure schools and parents are on the same page as to what happens in the case of all types of an emergency.</p><p>Resources for Teachers and the Budget: I would propose budgets are trimmed in an effort to maximize resources for the basics and learning and with the hopes to cut the amounts of fees that parents have to pay.</p><p>World Leading Curriculum: Admit that discovery math is the reason math scores keep declining and go back to the old methods. Make sure cursive writing and assignments done in proper hand writing are still mandatory. Watch and scrutinize the NDPs overhaul of the K-4 curriculum that is to be completed by December 2018. And ensure all social and cultural topics do not get priority when parents want their children learning and improving in basic education. Stop experimenting on the children.</p><p>Lastly I would like all Calgary Public Schools to sing 'O Canada' every Monday morning like we did when I was in school.</p>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HmYmwoQiHQ,"<p>My name is Karen Draper. I am 35 years old, and have lived in Calgary for 14 years. I was born in Saskatchewan, moved to B.C. with my father when I was 12, and was living on my own since I was 17. My first job was in Banff cleaning hotel rooms at the Banff Springs Hotel. I returned to Kamloops and worked doing the same thing for a couple more years, but at that time work in B.C. was very slow. In 2004 I moved to Calgary and have loved being an Albertan ever since. In 2005 I received a Diploma in Accounting and Administration and found a great steady career in office work for several years until I decided to open my own business doing commercial and residential cleaning services. I have always been an independent, hardworking person. The last 3 years have been the best years of my life. My son was born November 2013, and he is my greatest accomplishment to date. I closed the doors on my business and allowed myself to be home with him as much as possible. Now that he will be going to school next year, I can't think of anything I'd rather do than participate in his education and help any way I can. I like to volunteer, spend time with family and friends, and really enjoyed this beautiful summer we had. My son and I got to go camping and spend time in beautiful rural Alberta, and we also shared a community garden that gave us a lot of work and chores to do. We are just reaping the rewards of such hard work. I am proud to be Canadian and proud of our city. Calgary is the best!</p>",https://www.facebook.com/karyn.draper.5,,,,,403-230-5069,k_draper@shaw.ca,

In Silverado a new school is opening in November. How well will children transition? In Cranston we are worried about whether the school will ever be finished. Families everywhere are concerned about the new curriculum. What will this bode for their children in the future? How will it affect departmental exams for the children who switch curricula in high school?</p><p>I listen to parents. Key frustrations involve transportation concerns, worries regarding math scores, and concerns regarding meeting the educational needs of their special needs children. People are very concerned with the obscure new report cards that read like Newspeak from a George Orwell novel.</p><p>CBE takes pride in its diverse programs theoretically offered to all publicly schooled families. However, congregated bus stops specifically omit families without access to an adult escorting their child to a distant bus stop. Congregated stops have been tried before, and each time, it hurts students in “optional” programs such as immersion, and traditional learning programs. This creates a two tier educational system out of step with the mandate of CBE. This is a complex issue, and there are no easy answers. I will fight for the rights of all parents to have access for their children to ALL aspects of education offered by CBE.</p><p>Can we learn from other school boards in Alberta how to streamline our spending? Can we look at spending in other countries like Finland, which ranks in the top 3 in the world for educational achievement on a tight budget?</p><p>Our math scores have been falling consistently since the introduction of Discovery math. What is going on in our schools? Parents need to supplement their children with tutors at significant cost. This also creates a two tier system that is at odds with the CBE mandate of school for everyone.</p><p>Parents of special needs children are frustrated. Individual Learning Plans are not working. Parents are required to become experts on educating their child and then pass that on to teachers. 1 in 5 children has a language based learning disability, such as dyslexia. 1 in 20 children has ADHD. 1 in 68 children have autism. Teachers are frustrated because, for many, their education on teaching special needs children is learned on the fly, in the classroom. In every classroom, on average 5 children are likely to need intensive interventions.</p><p>If elected I will advocate for a central hub of information teachers can access to help navigate the needs of students. A cheap intervention that allows teachers to share resources, so no teacher has to reinvent the wheel. The more practical information they have access to, already successfully implemented by other teachers, the better off they are. Teachers work hard. They deserve autonomy, trust, and a toolkit for doing the job that they signed on for.</p><p>I am listening. And I want to help you get the Board of Education you deserve.</p>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCICSdSH3lE,"<p>Samantha MacLeod has a passion for education. She draws on her experience as a parent that has children at every stage of schooling:  High school, middle school and elementary school.  Dealing with Individual Learning Plans and advocating for her own children have given her crucial insight to the issues facing schools regarding children with special needs, as well as the roadblocks parents face in advocating for their children.  She is also keenly aware of the concerns facing children of all ranges of ability in a diverse learning environment.  As an integral member of her community she listens to the parents around her.  Families are worried.  They want to know that the changes of the last few years will not have lasting negative effects on their children.</p><p>Deeply involved in education and parenting based communities and organizations, including the First 2000 Days, she is an engaged member of the community working hard for you.  Her contributions, insight, and compassion have been sincerely appreciated.

We like hearing about the strengths of the Calgary Board of Education (CBE). At the same time, we want to face short-comings where they exist. The way to do this is by having Trustees who work well together and who ask the right questions. Trustees need to have the courage to follow up and to press for complete answers. Trustees must be able to tell when they need more information to make sound decisions. Sara has that skill set.</p><p>For years, there have been complaints about a lack of transparency. Surprisingly, we have seen great increases in the amount of information available. Monitoring reports and budgets include more information all the time. Yet there is still a sense that we aren’t getting straightforward answers. We want plain language. Sara will help bring this change, resulting in a well-run, open and transparent system.</p><p>Every student deserves great reading instruction</p><p>Currently too many students don’t read well and many teachers aren’t getting the support they need to be able to teach reading effectively. The literacy strategy hasn’t yet had parent/public input. It isn’t focussed on the most critical need of students. So far, it’s very broad and aspirational. It doesn’t specifically focus on ensuring that students can read. Nor does it identify where more resources will be dedicated. This can change with the right input from the Board of Trustees. Every student benefits when every student in the class can read.</p><p>Recent information suggests that the province will no longer require Student Learning Assessments at Grade 3. CBE will need to take a careful look at how parents are going to know if their children can read as expected. Sara’s expertise with respect to reading and assessment will help guide these discussions.</p><p>Every student deserves great math instruction</p><p>Students must develop math competence! Many parents have made it clear that this is a priority for them. CBE must be responsive. We want our students to have top-notch math skills. This means that students need foundations (knowledge of basic concepts and math facts) and strong reasoning and problem solving. It isn’t one or the other! Parents know that knowledge is a foundation for solving problems.</p><p>Many teachers agree with parents. They want to focus on both knowledge and problem solving. Many want to work in a system that values the use of direct instruction and the provision of practice opportunities when those are the techniques that best meet certain learning objectives or student learning needs. They know that discovery or inquiry approaches are not the only valuable teaching methods. Sara agrees. As a psychologist, she knows how memory and reasoning work together. She is perfectly positioned to work for sound policies and for the implementation of a Math Strategy across</p><p>CBE that is responsive to the public input and to scientific evidence of what works.</p>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1xgdNU0J8A,"<p>Sara was born in Edmonton, raised in Ontario and came back west for graduate school. She has been an enthusiastic Albertan ever since! Her career began in schools throughout Alberta. She was a travelling consultant in the early 1990’s and became a psychologist in 1992. Sara moved to Calgary in 1997 and joined the Calgary Board of Education (CBE). She enjoyed being there for nearly 20 years, working hard for students and their families.</p><p>Sara cares deeply about public policy and education. She holds both B.Ed. and M. Ed degrees and has specific expertise with respect to reading and learning disabilities. Sara spent most of her time with CBE at the system level. She collaborated with senior leaders, area personnel, school principals and school staff across the city. She knows how the system works. She knows what is going well and what the public is not so pleased about. Sara communicates well with parents, the public, and educators; she knows both the “language” of the school system as well as how real people think and speak in our communities.</p><p>Sara believes that it is critical to consider how public resources are used to further the well being of our community: Who gets what? At what cost? She thinks we should base policy and budget decisions on our shared values and priorities.</p><p>Others describe Sara as principled, thoughtful, articulate, dedicated and caring. She is well positioned to represent and to safeguard the interests of students, parents and the broader public.</p>",https://www.facebook.com/SaraJPeden,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarapeden4cbetrustee/,https://twitter.com/SaraJPeden,,587-893-8160,sara@sarapeden.ca,http://www.sarapeden.ca/

She believes all children should have equal access to a well-rounded public education, with the support of specialized staff for those who need it. Special needs students, including those with chronic medical conditions, are being left behind. They need stronger policies and support to ensure that they have the tools necessary to be a successful student.</p><p>Tory will advocate for an increase to sustained funding from the provincial government, to improve and continue the programming offered by the CBE and provide transportation for alternative programs. Parents are experiencing too many problems with the recent changes in transportation and bell times. A solution needs to be found to allocate funding for these students, to get them to school safely and efficiently. The changes in bell times have caused hardship for many parents who work and have to get multiple children to different schools. Consultation with caregivers needs to take place in order to achieve a better solution. Better financial planning and strategic allocation of funds is necessary to solve these problems.</p><p>She believes our children deserve full day kindergarten.

Our youth is our future; therefore, deserve the best resources available. I believe in maintaining excellence in Catholic education by supporting the needs of students, staff and parents.</p><p>The demands on students today can often be overwhelming and incredibly stressful. Programs such as ‘Champions’ allow every student to connect with at least one trusted adult they can turn to. These programs are essential and beneficial as   resources and mentorship for all students.</p><p>All district schools have an established ‘Catholic Community of Caring’ (CCC) based on the values of faith, caring, respect, responsibility, trust and family. CCC focuses on building respectful and compassionate school environments rooted with Catholic values where all students need to be supported and cared for in a sensitive and compassionate manner.</p><p>With the increasing demands and complexity of classroom dynamics, teachers consistently face new and growing challenges in order to meet the needs of students. It is important that teachers are supported with the proper tools, skill sets, resources and professional development in order to be effective leaders and role models to our future generation.</p><p>Parents, being the main educators of their children, need to see the value of forums available to them which will aid them in the process of effectively educating their children: our future.</p><p>Studies have shown that students of engaged parents tend to perform better at school; the more engaged the parents, the more successful the students.</p><p>As the City of Calgary continues to grow and flourish, so do the needs in our communities. It is crucial to maintain high standards of Catholic Education by providing Catholic Schools in every new community to accommodate for this growth.</p><p>The value of a Catholic Education is immeasurable. Alberta is fortunate to have a Catholic School District with over 55,000 students. It is essential to protect this valuable asset as the gift that it is serving today’s Catholic Youth.</p><p>A catholic education is a blessing ‐ it should be protected and cherished.</p>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaDwrYEmcU8,"<p>~The things you are passionate about are not random, they are your calling~</p><p>Fabienne Fredrickson</p><p>Lory Iovinelli is a native Calgarian with a caring disposition who is passionate about the well being of young people.
