Mayor,Andre Chabot,challenger,Andre Chabot - Mayor,"TAXES:My tax promise to Calgarians:1.	Keep tax increase at or below inflation. I pledge that I will not increase property taxes greater than inflation.2.	No more taking the tax room. I will never vote in favour of taking the provinces’ tax space.3.	No new taxes. Regardless of what authority the new city charter gives the Mayor, I will not support any new fee or tax.Changing the way we tax small businesses:We used to rely on big companies, especially the oil and gas sector to shoulder a large part of our nonresidential property tax. With the economic downturn, that revenue can no longer be relied upon, pushing more of the non‐residential tax burden to small business.We need to: Create specific categories for different types of businesses (ie. restaurants, small and large businesses) to minimize the shift in taxes from one sector to another.What this means to small business owners is that during tough economic times their incremental tax burden would be lessened regardless of what occurs in non‐residential sectors. They would not see a huge increase year over year which they are currently experiencing.SPENDING:I have been recognized as a fiscally responsible and detail oriented member of Council. I am proud of my record, I always show up with ideas on how to trim back and be more efficient.Municipal governments are challenged in delivering services to their residents due to the limited options to raise revenue. The bulk of the City’s revenue is raised through property tax, user fees and investment income. Sixty per cent of that revenue is spent on the City’s operating costs for salaries.•	I will call for restraint in future union salary increase to reflect our current economic reality and work towards achieving greater parity between private and public sector agreements.•	I will balance needs for service while being fiscally responsible.•	I commit to hiring subject matter experts in different fields, within the Mayor’s budget, to assess the efficiency of city departments to bring forward recommendations to improve the operational efficiency of The City.INFRASTRUCTURE:Council’s focus needs to be on building what we can afford, but also planning for the future. Major infrastructure projects like the Green Line are a great idea, but we don’t have the money to do it all at once.With new technology like autonomous vehicles hitting the market in the near future, we need to reassess our priorities to ensure that we can move people as efficiently as possible. We need to focus on improving existing infrastructure to respond to the increasing demand for private transportation, instead of focusing the priority solely on public transportation.As Mayor, I will continue to advocate for investments in public transportation and reprioritize the upgrades to current infrastructure and intersections to ease traffic congestion."
Mayor,Bill Smith,challenger,Bill Smith - Mayor,"“I am running for Mayor to get the city of Calgary back on course.  We need to control reckless spending, make streets safer and rein in excessive tax increases. These are the challenges the next council will face.  It will take a strong, creative, thoughtful leader to succeed. I am that leader. It’s time for a change. Calgary, we need a new Mayor.”STRONG COLLABORATIVE LEADERSHIPRespect begins at the top. I will work to create a team-focused environment at City Hall. A culture that establishes clear and meaningful priorities which has genuine respect for the community feedback process.And the city must keep its word. We will not abandon the residents of Midfield Park. The city promised them an alternative location. That is what they shall have.An efficient city council needs to encourage the economy, not interfere with business. City bureaucracy and red tape needs to make way for responsible leadership to foster a strong economy.I will streamline regulations to guarantee response time for development applications. It takes too long for projects to get approved. We need to attract businesses to Calgary.That is what an efficient city council can do to encourage the economy.LOWER TAXES / COST CONTROLEffective leadership has been absent at City Hall. Council operations have degenerated to a point where new positions have been created that provide no direct value to Calgarians.  For example, the first ethics advisor and an integrity commissioner were hired in 2016 because council was unable to govern itself in a professional, ethical manner. A 2017 City Clerks’ report even proposed to pay $170 thousand dollars a year for someone to run their meetings, which makes no sense.This demonstrates zero comprehension of Calgary’s economic reality. Our city is in the third year of a recession. Tens of thousands have lost their jobs and many more have had their salaries slashed.City Hall’s response is a 51% tax hike for residents and 70% tax hike for business.The City needs to cut unnecessary spending, rein in rampant tax increases, streamline operations, maximize efficiencies and stop paying millions of dollars to consultants for more studies.It’s time for a common sense approach.SAFE AND VIBRANT COMMUNITIESI have the greatest respect for the first responders that serve our city. These are the brave men and women who risk their lives on a daily basis to make our community safe for the rest of us.In recent years we’ve seen crime dramatically increase on our streets, in our homes and on our public transit system. The recent city budget called for hiring 15 new people. Were they police officers?  No, they were communications bureaucrats.Everyone has a role to play in making our city safe, but it starts with the Mayor and City Council. We must ensure that there are adequate and efficiently deployed resources for Police and FireYour hard earned taxpayer dollars should be spent prudently and where needs are greatest."
Mayor,Brent Chisholm,challenger,Brent Chisholm - Mayor,"Hello, my name is Brent Chisholm.I’m in the running to become the next Mayor of Calgary; at the same time the best one who has ever held  the position. Saying that, I will be fulfilling my mayoralty obligations and doing what is Best for the city of Calgary at home and abroad.I will not be doing any shady deals to handicap or hinder  company for benefit of a certain one. I call a spade a spade and if I’m asked, I’ll answer the question to the best of my knowledge, most likely do some more research on that and on other matters also.  I will lead by example and I’m asking the citizens of this city to call their alderperson if there is something that they don’t like in their neighborhood. I’d like them to document the date, time, and who they spoke to even if it was an answering machine. If they don’t get a call back from that alderperson in a week, call me on the eighth day so I can round up some city employees in that particular division and have it dealt with. I wouldn’t be surprised if I’m out on the job helping get it completed. Team work gets it done Faster and Better.I want the politicians to work for their money instead of bankrolling the public. When I get 2000 phoned in complaints from the citizens of this city I’ll be asking those citizens to fax me the documents that they wrote up on the date, time, who they spoke to, and if that problem was dealt with and by whom  in a timely fashion. I’ll be inviting said citizens who had complaints and to city hall so they can voice their neglect to said alderpersons. If certain alderpersons aren’t doing their job that they’re being paid for to tell them there Fired! I want all of city council, including myself to be held accountable to the citizens of this city. I personally would like to abolish the pension plan for alderpersons and the Mayor. They can collect old age pension when they get that age if anything is left. If they can’t live off the wage that they’re getting then they shouldn’t be where there at!  I’d like to bring the wages back to reality and if alderpersons or other mayoralty candidates want to keep fleecing the citizens of this city on how much their worth, that means they’re not worth it!I am Best Value as a person that’s running for Mayor and the Best person to give this city’s citizens theBest Bang for their Buck!!Thank you,Brent ChisholmFor the next term as your Mayor."
Mayor,David Lapp,challenger,David Lapp - Mayor,"I pledge to you:1.	To remember it’s your money, not mine.•	Initiate a full forensic audit of all the city’s dealings – operating budgets AND capital budgets•	Restrain spurious City Hall expenditures through getting back to basic services in the city•	Initiate a long and lasting tax cut to businesses and residents in this city2.	To keep your family safe.•	Bring law and order back to the streets of Calgary•	Bring community policing back with beat cops and quality community liaisons•	Reenergize policing by continuing to build bridges between Alberta Health Services, the Police, homeless agencies, families, churches, schools and community representatives with a collaborative approach3.	To keep Calgary’s neighbourhoods and Community Associations as the focal point of decision making.•	Rebirth our whole citywide model of Community Associations, working to enshrine certain legislative powers at the neighbourhood level•	Directly support families as the key building block of our city•	Facilitate the development of before and after school care initiatives at key neighbourhood focal pointsCalgary’s economy is in a tailspin. Our unemployment is at a record high and there are vast amounts of people living in poverty. This is not the same city that it used to be. Calgary is at a crossroads and Calgarians should consider their choice very carefully when they take to the polls. This is a generational election. The issues being debated today will affect this city for decades.Calgarians know that City Hall’s spending priorities are heading in exactly the wrong direction. Instead of funding basic services like transit, police, fire, roads and the like, City Hall has gone on a spacewalk experimenting with social engineering, income redistribution and vanity projects. The Blue Ring and Bowfort Towers characterize the train wreck of City Hall malpractice, which proves how out of touch they are with the average Calgarian.As many Calgarians know, the violent crime rate in Calgary has risen in a more aggressive fashion then in any other major Canadian city. A Lapp administration would be unequivocal on tough-on-crime measures. A more affective police funding model needs to be adopted and more dynamic relationships need to be built between police and community stakeholders. The best approach to fighting crime is two pronged: 1) Fund more beat patrols, and 2) Stimulate a sense of belonging in our neighbourhoods. City Hall should be facilitating strong initiatives for families in our communities, such as before and after school programs, daycare and nutritional programs for children. It also goes without saying that the police and neighbourhoods should be working together to confront the opioid crisis head on.  Calgary needs a police force that enforces laws, prevents crime trends and stimulates life in every corner of our society."
Mayor,Emile Gabriel,challenger,Emile Gabriel - Mayor,"1-Streamlining and improving the process of making critical decisions at council to make it efficient, effective and productive.A- Genuine public involvement (true direct democracy and true representation. I plan to provide more opportunities for greater community engagement and public consultations).B- Available modern management techniques and tools in prioritizing, debating, eliminating bias, reaching consensus and making the best decisions and choices for the people of our city will be utilized.This would result in significant multiple positive effects, leading to business and economic growth, employment opportunities, easing the cost of housing and providing better city mobility, ultimately, achieving residents' satisfaction.  Economic growth and employment opportunities are essential ingredients for increasing SAFETY.2- Intelligently, thoughtfully and carefully reforming the city taxation system.- Short term: Saving money by cutting waste, duplication, ending unwise spending and postponing non-urgent or ill-conceived projects to allow for freezing taxes for a reasonable, fixed period of time (to provide also a sense of stability), while maintaining essential services.- Long term: Taxes to be made affordable and conducive while providing a cushion to weather economic down turns.3- Growing the EconomyHaving been an entrepreneur, I understand the difficulties facing the business community, the uncertainty and unpredictability. City rules, regulations, policies and by-laws will need modernization and simplification in order to:- Replace the current practices of random, slow, wasteful, scattered and under-funded plans and projects.- Incite business growth and attract new investments and capital, thus, generate new employments and increase revenue."
Mayor,Larry Heather,challenger,Larry Heather - Mayor,"1. Cut City Staffing by one-third. City Hall is a Growth Panning Monstrosity afflicted with the  organizational equivalent of gigantism. Unnecessary and distortion producing growth due to pituitary overproduction of HGH.2. Reversal of the renaming of Langevin Bridge to Reconciliation Bridge. Restraining over emphasis of Aboriginal input, and dumping of invocation of Treaty Seven sovereignty that replaced the Council Prayer. Educate on the false historical revisionism of Canada’s History.

Mayor,Naheed Nenshi,incumbent,Naheed Nenshi - Mayor,"Seven years ago, you gave me the incredible opportunity to serve as your mayor and to work with you to realize your hopes and dreams for Calgary.Together, we have accomplished so much. Even in difficult economic times, even where global forces of division seem to be winning, Calgary remains one of the best places in the world to live: The Economist calls us one of the five best cities to live in the entire world.The last seven years, we’ve seen tremendous change in Calgary. We’ve invested more in infrastructure than ever before in our city – improving our road networks, building social infrastructure like recreation centres and libraries, and strengthening public transit. Our city is better planned and we’re in excellent financial shape, with the lowest taxes of any major city in Canada and a stellar credit rating.But we must keep moving forward. This is not the time to retrench; it’s not the time to give in to smaller dreams nor the time to give up. My platform centers around three distinct themes.Better Economy - We are in the midst of a fragile economic recovery, which must be sustained. Too many of our neighbours continue to feel the pain of unemployment and uncertainty about the future. We have to work in three areas: Selling Calgary means promoting our city to businesses, investors and skilled workers around the globe. We also need to create centres of excellence and growth in new industries where we have strength but need to grow to become a major global player. We need to aggressively secure funding from other orders of government to help build infrastructure we need to strengthen our economy and improve our communities, like the Green Line LRT, which will be the largest public works project in Alberta’s history, while ensuring all projects are completed on time and on budget. Finally, promoting entrepreneurship and innovation; helping Calgarians reach their potential, selling our expertise globally and making it even easier to start a business. This means cutting even more red tape, helping City Hall be a partner in business success.Stronger and Safer Communities - Every neighbourhood in Calgary must be safe, and every person must have the chance to succeed. This means a new focus on safety, housing, addiction, poverty and the environment. It also means investing in community infrastructure like libraries, rec centres and firehalls, ensuring we build the flood mitigation we need, and promoting and protecting our diversity every single day.Smarter City Hall – Using our citizen-centric approach, we’ve found over $325 million in efficiencies and kept Calgary’s taxes the lowest of any big city in Canada. But we need to do more: finding efficiencies, reforming the assessment and appeals process, making it easier to do business with the City, and using the City Charter to get even better.There’s a choice this election: turtle and hope the economic downturn passes, or boldly keep moving forward. That choice is clear."
Ward 1,Cam Khan,challenger,Cam Khan - Ward 1,"As Bow River flows in the heart of our communities, lets us make Ward-1 one the best neighborhoods for the living and raising the families, safest, naturally beautiful, healthiest, and scenic community in the entire city of Calgary. Following are few highlights of communities improvements plans:- Freshly painted, nice &amp; clean roads. Snow removal on time. Front yard and community lawns' grass on time mowing.- Many communities need new Schools e.g. Valley Ridge &amp; Crestmont.  I will fight for your rights on these and similar issues.- Lots of intersections in our communities need traffic lights. Many communities need ice hockey rinks and basket ball courts. I will work on these essential recreational necessities.- Outdoor children play grounds need to be upgraded &amp; renovated. Communities need more cycle and pedestrian paths. I will be your voice for all these matters.- Together we will work towards small business corporations' tax breaks. I will be your voice in the city council for property tax relief as well.- NW communities' high demand for LRT link from University to Calway park through 16th Avenue, I will bring this your long-standing proposal on the table of the council.- Subsidies for gyms for qualifying community individuals.- One subsidized back and forth fast LRT &amp; BRT commute to downtown every day (7:00 am &amp; return 5:00 pm).-Community entertainment night once every 3 months. Free movie in the community hall and much more!- Abundant flower beds and plenty of lush green areas will be flourished.I am asking all my neighborhoods families and friends for Vote on October 16, 2017, for positive changes in our community."
Ward 1,Chris Blatch,challenger,Chris Blatch - Ward 1,"WHAT DO I STAND FOR?Everyone deserves a Sensible, Approachable, Accessible, and Personable City Council. I am devoted to open dialogue, and sensible coherent policies based on a common sense approach that understands, listens, and values constituents. I will be your voice to ensure:1: Accountability &amp; PrioritizationI will ensure Council identifies and organizes it’s priorities.The Current Council tries to defer responsibility by delegating vital decisions to unaccountable committees. They refuse to make decisions and pour money into unending studies to avoid accountability.In tough economic times, tough decisions need to be made.Unfortunately, we can’t have it all. I will make certain that Council’s first focus is on necessities, and only then moves forward with other reasonable projects. I will keep constituents informed of what is impacting their communities, ensuring Calgarians know the decisions I make and the reasons behind them.2: Fiscal Responsibility:Council must learn to “live within its means”. Taxpayers are not a bottomless source of funds. I am dedicated to identifying which projects are necessary, viable, and will have the greatest return on investment. I will uphold the responsibility of ensuring that every dollar is used wisely, doing away with frivolous spending. I will not forget that every tax dollar comes from the homes of hard working Calgarians.3: Decency &amp; DecorumCalgarians deserve a City Council they can be proud of. A Council that acts on behalf of Calgarians, rather than themselves. I will stand against petty rivalries, rude behavior, and the embarrassing antics that are often displayed within out current Council. As your representative, my duty is to ensure your voice is heard and your concerns are fairly addressed. It’s time to change the unprofessional behavior that has become the daily norm at City Hall.4: Sensible Transit InfrastructureCalgary needs coherent infrastructure policies, that ensures affordable and effective transportation for all Calgarians. We need to make it cheap and easy to jump on city transit, and for Calgarians to be able to travel by road quickly and safely.5: Safe Livable CommunitiesCouncil must focus on common sense ways to ensure our communities are safe and livable. Front-line community-based policing is vital for the healthy growth of our city. Communities need safe roads, adequate green spaces, recreation opportunities, and accessible amenities –such as markets and libraries– to keep our communities vibrant places we want to live."
Ward 1,Cole Christensen,challenger,Cole Christensen - Ward 1,"As Ward 1 councillor, I would advocate for sustainable street planning and transportation options, a reformed secondary suite process, no corporate handouts, and an increased accessibility to voting for eligible residents."
Ward 1,Coral Bliss Taylor,challenger,Coral Bliss Taylor - Ward 1,"PUBLIC ENGAGEMENTI see the councillorship as a direct conduit from the public to the city operations. The upcoming election is the foundation of this engagement but I believe the public deserves to be engaged on a regular basis. The council votes on issues constantly and councillors that maintain a close ear to the ground will be best positioned to best represent their Ward. I’ll use methods like regularly engaging community centres and organizations or improving public access to the council Integrity Commission. I will bring the issues that matter to you, to City Hall. I will be “walking this talk” during both the campaign, and throughout my tenure as councillor.ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATIONI believe that economic diversification is the key to our future here in Calgary, and that starts at the ground level. More independent businesses are being started by our neighbours than ever before and North America is progressively looking to Calgary as an environment to invest. We see unprecedented local growth in areas like Tech and Manufacturing. A supportive municipal government is integral to maintaining this pace. As Councillor, I'll ensure the City of Calgary supports the local economy with local sourcing, something it does not currently prioritize.COLLEGIALITYI see team work amongst colleagues in City Council as the most important element in the success of their initiatives. The decisions and programs councillors spend their time on have lasting impacts on the day to day lives of Calgarians. From cumbersome secondary suite controls to seniors centres, or from expensive olympic bids to strained police budgets, efficiencies begin within our council chambers. Each Ward deserves a thoughtful and collegial representative as they bring their unique perspectives forth on issues affecting Calgary as a whole. When Calgary is run by a team, it can more quickly and effectively address issues. This starts with creating a positive environment for Ward 1 communities, and making sure your needs are addressed."
Ward 1,Ward Sutherland,incumbent,Ward Sutherland - Ward 1,"Every community has unique needs and important priorities. Ward prides himself in working closely with all communities in Ward 1 to ensure he understands their issues and can advocate for them most effectively.Lowering taxes, traffic safety, community infrastructure, and seamless school drop-offs and pick-ups are all key issues. Ward focuses on four key values and applies this thinking to all community problems that he works to solve: Accountable Leadership, Common Sense, Lowering Taxes, and being Community Driven.Accountable LeadershipAccountability and Leadership are two of Ward’s personal “musts” to consistently achieve positive results. Ward’s skills and experience have enabled him to “get into the weeds” of financial reporting, and has resulted in his leadership around the City’s move to zero-base budget reviews; this has resulted in significant savings for the tax payer.Common SenseCommon sense seems obvious, but it takes a true leader and community advocate to step back and advocate for practical policies that work for Calgary’s modern families. As the father of two girls, a husband, and a son Ward understands the commitments the average Calgarian has to juggle to ensure their families are provided for, safe, and have all the opportunities to succeed.Lowering TaxesWard has been a strong advocate for lowering taxes and unnecessary burdens on all Calgarians. Fiscal prudence starts with the individual and Ward is committed to continuing to be a strong voice for ensuring more of your hard-earned dollars stay in your pocket - where they belong.Community DrivenCrime reduction, increased traffic safety and calmness measures, upgraded infrastructure, access in times of emergency, and advocating for individual communities at the provincial level are all ways Ward has shown he is passionate about representing each community. As a past president of his local community association he has become a skilled advocate for community issues. His commitment to supporting the communities and residents of Ward 1 has never wavered; he has attended 1,046 (and counting) community events and meetings during his first term as Councillor.Ward’s approach has been successful during his first term as Ward 1 Councillor. His passion, dedication, and hard work have led to several achievements, including:o	Upgraded roads, sidewalks, community buildings, pathways and parkso	Traffic calming measures, improved access, and increased safety on our Ward 1 roadso	Recreational facilities including the Bowness Park splash park, Silver Springs outdoor pool, Shouldice Athletic Park, and the Shane Homes rec centreWard 1 residents need a representative that will continue to advocate for their best interests. There are many projects on the go and Ward has the experience, leadership, and results-based attitude to ensure projects are completed and constituents’ voices are heard."
Ward 2,Christopher Maitland,challenger,Christopher Maitland - Ward 2,"I am running for Ward 2 Councillor because I believe City Hall no longer works for Calgarians.  More and more over the years we are seeing a very entitled Council where instead of listening and working for our wishes and our needs they are telling us what as Calgarians WE NEED.   I believe a councilor should put forward ideas but they need to be based from the community and citizen input, wishes and desires.    I want to bring a return to true grassroots politics where YOU the citizens of Calgary are in control, not a  council of entitled people nor the administration that has been running city hall for years.I will state a few of my key platforms here today.-Recall, we need the ability to recall and fire our elected officials if they no longer represent our wishes.   There should not be a free 4 year pass to do whatever you wish.   In the private sector if your boss (citizens of Calgary) do not feel served by their employee (councilor or mayor) then they would fire them-Councilor wage freeze and reduction of benefits (also for the ward office staff)  You lead by example pure and simple if you ask Calgarians to buckle down in these tough times you should be the first to do so.   I want a 4 year wage freeze and a 15% reduction in benefits.  I would also pass a motion to reduce the ward office budget by 10%-Elimination of Councilor pensions to be replaced by a defined contribution RRSP.    It is not practical to ask tax payers to be on the hook for pensions in the public sector any longer, its a undefined liability that is costing us too much.-All city departments are to go to a Zero based budget system.  Simply put these city departments for too long have never had to justify their budgets and as such are increasing year after year, often to add more unneeded management and communications staff not the needed front line workers.   If we need to increase the city budget (which increases taxes) council MUST show they have done everything possible to make it as efficient as possible.  Any budget cuts must start at the management level not front line staff,  front line needs to be protected.-Market diversity and red tape.   They are buzzwords yes but only because council does not act on them.  We throw numerous bylaws and permits where they are not needed.  Lets truly look at reducing the number of bylaws when possible and making a standard for something as simple as a business wanting to put a sign up on their own building.     City hall gives blanket permits to construction companies why not charities and community organizations lets let these amazing dedicated groups do their jobs and no burden them with approvals and permits when they are not needed.  If a community organization wants to do a community gathering in a park and they meet the standards set,  they can simply just put on the event.  Sounds simple but administration makes it very hard.Lets Put Calgarians back in Charge."
Ward 2,Jennifer Wyness,challenger,Jennifer Wyness - Ward 2,"Building a better Calgary for families and seniors1)	Fiscal Responsibility. To make sure every tax dollar collected is utilized to maximize value added services and infrastructure to constituents. Many city council members, including the incumbent WARD 2 councilor, voted to keep the City budget unchanged year over year but voted in favour of taking more of the budget for their own salaries, this is not in the best interest of Calgarians and does not increase value added services and improve infrastructure.So many Calgarians are either on a tight budget or fixed income. I will focus on making difficult decisions, on what best serves Calgarians, and what is the best use of limited resources to improve quality and abundance of services for Calgarians.2)	Accountability and transparency in City Council. The current city council is ineffective. They continue to dip into reserves year over year, without solving the problems and looking at ways to be more efficient. They spend numerous hours in meetings away from the public eye and act in unprofessional and childish ways. Calgarian’s want leadership that shows the voters, and the world, the hard working and creative people who make up this great city. It has been too long that big donors and lobbyists have controlled City Council, and it is time for tax payers to have their voices heard.I plan to have active open forums and open dialogue through physical meetings and internet forums so that constituents always have a voice.3)	Innovative and effective Public Services. It is not enough to continue doing things the way they have always been done. Public Services and Infrastructure have to be managed in creative and efficient ways that maximize the value added benefits to Calgarian’s without spending more money. For too long City Council has approached services and infrastructure by a method of throwing money at problems and seeing what works. This has been witnessed by never ending expensive reviews and bad financial management. Calgarian’s want a leader who makes the difficult decisions, communicates with their constituents and works with others to find creative ways to solve problems without spending more money.4)	Be the future of Canada. Calgary is the youngest and most dynamic city in Canada, and our city council should reflect this. It is time to remove what has not been working and bring in new, young fresh leadership and ideas. Calgary needs leadership that showcases our city and is committed for the long haul. Leadership that focuses on what is best for the families of Calgary. Calgarians have had enough of double dipping councilors and politicians who are out of touch with the modern world. They spend taxpayers money without common sense. We are a youthful and dynamic North American City, our politicians need to showcase this."
Ward 3,Connie Hamilton,challenger,Connie Hamilton - Ward 3,"Ward 3 has been betrayed and ignored by city council.The $4.6 Billion Green Line being slashed in half and cut off from our communities. This council betrayed even the federal government on this, they proposed one plan to receive funds and then tore up the proposal.Harvest Hills Golf Course sold without residents knowledge until a land use application was made and then that notice went to only the homes directly bordering the course. This is an underhanded way to deal with communities, we were forced to scramble without any help from our city councilor. Despite the efforts of the Northern Hills Community Association, Citizens for Responsible Development, over 5000 letters &amp; emails from concerned residents and the attendance for every engagement meeting saying No repeatedly, this course was destroyed. The whole process heavily favors the developers and those developers have to do very little to get approval. This system needs to change and the City needs to set much higher standards for builders and developers in the future. What is the next space they want? Who can you trust to vote for your community.Calgarians are out of work in record numbers because of the recession still gripping our province and this city council has done little to focus on jobs and business opportunities. They have failed to react to economic conditions and their solutions as always is to raise taxes. Your taxes and fee increases since 2011 have been raised by 51% and in 2018 after this election they are planning to increase them again.Stupid Spending needs to stop, we have to protect our tax dollars and use them to benefit more people. City Council spends a huge amount on ego projects that benefit very few. Some current examples would be;Bike lanes costing $5.6 million it’s under budget and a few people are using them they say, but 1.2 million Calgarians can’t ride a bike to work.Pedestrian bridges costing $50 million and counting, they go nowhere and while taking photos on the peace bridge is cool that money could have gone into communities with real needs.The 1% Art rule, after 13 years this spending program needs a total revamp possibly the money could be redirected more inside of communities, not just downtown and along roadways. I would prefer to see interactive art in playgrounds, school yards and local artists working with local builders on multi use pieces that bring a smile to your face. Stop trying to impress the world and focus spending towards what benefits more Calgarians.Common sense and taking care of people needs to be the new rule set by city council. They have failed and changes are urgently needed inside ward 3. Someone new who can’t be bullied or bought and who speaks up for people. Being politically correct does not make you correct. What makes you correct is how you act for people who voted you into the chair and trust you to have their backs."
Ward 3,Ian McAnerin,challenger,Ian McAnerin - Ward 3,"My priorities can be summed up as: Effective, Accountable, and Responsible.EFFECTIVEAn effective representative of Ward 3 needs to listen closely to the residents, form a clear plan, and then follow through. Complaining in a meeting doesn’t work– you need to actually win hearts and minds. Trained as a lawyer, this is what I do – fight for the people I represent using every means at my disposal.An example of the current Council ineffectiveness is the Secondary Suites issue, which all members of the current council promised they would fix back in 2013, yet is still taking up 15 to 20% of council time in 2017. What important items are going untouched because Council is wasting their time doing work easily handled by Administration?Effective also means working with multiple levels of government, not just sitting in the council sandbox. Major priorities like the Greenline LRT, North Central High School, 14st/Stoney Interchange and others require working together with multiple levels of government. I’m equally comfortable in the bureaucracies of Calgary, Edmonton and Ottawa.ACCOUNTABLEI will bring transparency and accountability to the City of Calgary. We have a city Council that went “in camera” (a secret meeting) 748 times last year. The city of Toronto only went “in camera” 18 times.We have a city that talks a lot about “engagement” but in practice just makes a decision then shows up at meetings to present the finished plan, rather than truly engaging people. This happened with both the Harvest Hills Golf Course and the Greenline LRT, for example. We have public art projects using your money with little to no public input.I have professional experience in balancing the need for privacy with the need for transparency, and I know how to achieve that balance by working with everyone involved.RESPONSIBLEThe city of Calgary is facing many issues: population growth, environmental disasters, and an economic downturn. Our downtown has a 30-40% vacancy rate. We live on a flood plain. Despite this, people love this city and keep coming here to live. All of this needs to be managed in a responsible manner.We can’t just slash and burn every budget – there are many vulnerable people who need to be cared for. We certainly can’t tax and spend our way out of it. We need to be smart, with heart.I’ve got decades of experience with making projects and budgets work. I know when to invest in things that pay off, and when to cut the fat and find efficiencies.There are 3 groups – Developers/Business, City Admin, and City Council. Each should act as a check and balance on the others. When we get developers taking over Council, or Council interfering with City Admin, or City Admin interfering with business and development, we have problems.I commit to the responsibility of keeping these critical checks and balances in place."
Ward 3,Jun Lin,challenger,Jun Lin - Ward 3,"1.	IMPROVE COUNCIL TRANSPARENCY.I will work for you not the other way around. At a time when so many of our friends and neighbours are suffering from job loss, city hall needs to bring back fiscal discipline and ensure its priority is making Calgary the best place in Canada to do business. Instead they focus on vanity projects and forcing densification plans into our communities. Do you find this as frustrating as I do?2.	PROTECT TAXPAYERS.It is not acceptable to be bribed with our own money. I greatly value city services but we must live within our means. City council can no longer balance their books on massive year over year tax hikes that exceed inflation. I will hold city hall accountable on taxation and spending, while ensuring Ward 3 gets its fair share of city services.3.	DEFEND AND STRENGTHEN OUR COMMUNITIESOur current infrastructure is already stretched and strained to service our booming population. Adding to this pressure, new neighbourhoods are being built north of Stoney Trail without additional services like recreation and schools. I will fight to protect our existing recreational facilities, and to ensure that our current green spaces are protected. Further I strongly believe that our ward must get priority for the new Green Line LRT. I will fight to ensure we get no half measures on transit.4.	FIGHTING TO GET THE GREEN LINE BUILT NORTHWARDSCity Council’s decision to terminate the first phase of the Green Line LRT at 16th Avenue is slap in the face to the residents of Ward 3. The Harvest Hills/Centre Street corridor is the busiest bus corridor in the city. In other words, the ridership numbers support building the green line North before anywhere else. Ward 3 deserves access to the kind of high quality, high efficiency transit that LRT provides…and NOW, not 20 years from now. As your councilor, I will fight to get the transit we deserve."
Ward 3,Jyoti Gondek,challenger,Jyoti Gondek - Ward 3,"As your Ward 3 Councillor, I will fight for the things we need in north central Calgary to make our everyday lives better. I have spent my professional life understanding complex urban issues and identifying practical, proven ideas that can be adapted and successfully implemented in Calgary.Through my volunteer work in the community, professional experience and involvement on City of Calgary committees, I know how to work within our complex government to meet the expressed needs of residents to bring needed change. Here is my strategy for increased efficiency and effectiveness of City Council:1. Accelerate “zero based” departmental reviews to end the practice of regenerating annual budgets without a review of current needs and potential cost savings through partnerships, technology and/or innovative practices.2. Increase transparency in decision-making through spending less time behind closed doors. Open decision-making will lead to common understandings of situations, resulting in greater trust between residents and government.3. Better facilitation of Council meetings through implementing a pilot project for a rotating Chair or Speaker to identify the strongest Council member for the job. Hiring an external facilitator to manage Council meetings is a waste of money.Incorporating this efficiency strategy, I will also tackle the following priorities:1. Fight for the needs of Ward 3. Our government partners must step up and invest in much needed improvements in Ward 3, like access to local schools and community amenities, as well as improved traffic management and transit options. I will challenge all 3 levels of government to develop practical solutions for critical infrastructure shortcomings.2. Smarter funding models. Traditional funding models for cities involve the unpredictable and slow process of waiting for provincial and federal dollars. More certainty in funding can be achieved through practices like retaining a greater percentage of collected property taxes for our city and utilizing a community revitalization levy for projects in Ward 3.3. Address Calgary’s economic challenges. Members of City Council must work with the business community to identify ways to re-establish investors’ faith in our city’s future. We must work together to chart a new path, which includes maximizing the experience of the private sector in municipal partnerships and upgrading our dated approach to property tax assessments.4. Support a safe and caring city. The physical and mental wellness of Calgarians is a priority for the municipal government, yet we do not have a seat at the table when federal and provincial decision-makers create social policy. We must be engaged in determining how critical issues like housing, medical treatment and the fentanyl crisis are addressed in our local communities."

Ward 4,Greg Miller,challenger,Greg Miller - Ward 4,"We Can Do Better For Ward 4We enjoy terrific communities in Ward 4 and as residents we’re proud to call them home. But we face many challenges, including aging community infrastructure, overloaded public transit, pressure from new development, closing shops and disappearing green spaces. I worry we’re falling behind. Ward 4 deserves a Councillor who will be an informed, effective advocate for our communities. Here’s my plan to make Ward 4 better:1. Build Better Connections and Safer Streets•The Green Line LRT will end at 16th Ave in Stage One. I’ll fight to bring the Green Line north into Ward 4 and to get all Calgarians a step closer to an Airport train link.•Build the long overdue intersection upgrade at John Laurie and McKnight Boulevards.•Support cost-effective Bus Rapid Transit projects, especially across North Calgary and not just to downtown.•In 2016 Calgary averaged nearly a pedestrian collision per day, and nearly a pedestrian death per month. Let’s make our streets safer for people walking, biking, riding, and driving by investing in infrastructure for all modes of transportation.2. Spur Business Growth, Spend Responsibly•Make Calgary a top choice for businesses by building on our pro-business environment. Beyond great infrastructure and fair taxation, companies need housing choice, transportation choice and vibrant communities to attract and retain their workforces.•Ease the tax burden on small and medium businesses as Calgary’s economy continues to recover.•Attract local businesses and services our Ward 4 communities need to thrive.•Bend the cost curve on the City’s operating budget by better managing growth.•Without major concessions from the IOC, we should not spend billions on the Olympics.3. Invest In Our Aging Community Infrastructure•Secure our fair share of investment to maintain and improve Ward 4 infrastructure such as parks, libraries, rec centres, arenas, and community centres.•Work with school boards to bring more local children to our local schools.•Explore sharing opportunities among schools, community groups and seniors.•Invest in our precious green spaces that make our communities livable. The Highland Valley development does not benefit our communities and must be reconsidered.4. Promote Good, Sensible Development•Focus good development — and not just any development — along the edges of our communities, especially along transit corridors like Crowchild Trail and Centre Street.•Provide housing choice for our seniors, as well as young adults and their families.•Create local plans that respect existing communities and encourage investment in housing and services.•End the proliferation of unsafe illegal secondary suites and wasteful Council meetings by properly regulating safe, legal suites.Ward 4 deserves more. Please help me deliver more for you. Vote Greg Miller for Ward 4 Councillor."
Ward 4,Sean Chu,incumbent,Sean Chu - Ward 4,"When I was elected in 2013, I had a clear set of priorities:Better public transit for my Ward, given the challenges we face on Centre Street; making our streets safer for pedestrians and commutes better on our way home; and to bring fiscal accountability and common sense in spending decisions to City Hall. My focus has been these issues, and I want to continue the work that I have started with your help. Our Ward is a developed part of the City and as such we have challenges in improving our transit routes, renovating our community hubs, and ensuring that your property taxes are used properly for infrastructure. Needs vs. wants has always been my mantra.My largest focus during my first term was on the Green Line, and I succeeded in bringing what was only a line on a map, to construction starting in 2020. We were all disappointed by the City’s news that it would be phased. Nowhere in the reports and countless meetings I had, did the City say this would be the case. I fought for funding for the Green Line for a full 45km track, and will continue this fight if reelected. I have pushed the City to find savings so that we can build it north, and we have done that, so much that we could build it to 40th Avenue, two stops north of 16th Avenue.Second, I have also been the fiscal hawk at City Hall and have continuously pressured City Administration to find savings, review City programs, find innovative solutions to cut costs, and always asked my colleagues when we review budgets and spending to ask if this a need or a want. I will remain the defender of your tax dollars. I will continue to push for the City to keep reviewing all department budgets, and promote a culture of innovation in City staff to find ways to cut costs, in order to provide faster and more efficient services. I am also proposing a panel of small business owners and City administration to find ways to help businesses succeed, rather than be a hindrance to success. If small businesses succeed, our City does also.Finally, I have focused on practical traffic and pedestrian safety measures that make a difference to you and your family. I have pushed hard for repainting our crosswalks, and installing flashing pedestrian crosswalk signs, speed flashing signals, reflective tape on stop signs, in order to help decrease accidents and make it safer for our kids. I have also worked to make changes to major intersections to make traffic flow safer in rush hour, with more turn lights, and redesigned intersections.Better transit for our Ward, fiscal discipline, safety – these have been my areas of focus since 2013, and will continue to be my focus if I earn your support again on October 16th. I have been open, and transparent, and have always treated your tax dollars with respect. With your trust, I hope to continue the work I have started."
Ward 4,Srinivas Ganti,challenger,Srinivas Ganti - Ward 4,"The central plank of my candidacy is LEAN in MUNICIPAL GOVERNANCE, by which I mean , avoiding iterative loops and rework and aspiring for manufacturing level efficiencies in Council functioning and by extension City operations. This also means being able to answer how much value added work are we citizens getting for each tax $ expended on direct &amp; indirect works and not being satisfied with a simple attribution of each tax $ to various city departments and services.I support a robust and rigorous budget planning process based on empirical evidence doing identical work/projects and reliable cost models and oppose phased estimating approaches which invariably under‐estimate costs and risks and over‐estimate benefits and defer the reckoning of project profitability to the very end at which time it is too late. In support of the preceding, the city's external auditor should be tasked with reporting on the Capital spend efficiency @ City.To keep businesses competitive and in the interests of tax equity, I support the MMGA (Modernized Municipal Government Act – Bill 21) proposed linked tax ratio of 5:1 and support a franchise fee model based on cost of delivery alone and not total cost of utility supplied, so the volatility of cash flow from this stream is minimized. On the matter of secondary suites (SS) , where safe and all requirements for a secondary suite are met, permissible uses under current zoning should be the basis for approving or rejecting an application and I oppose council looking into every single SS application. On the matter of public art, I believe art is meant to be controversial but will insist on the incorporation of local content while acknowledging that monuments for public art have a tendency to grow on us over time. On the matter of affordable housing, I am committed to stacking municipal efforts on top of the federal governments National housing Strategy (2016) and Affordable housing initiative to replenish and renew affordable housing stock and am for flexible securitization and funding for social housing developers to cover all aspects of pre‐construction financing ( as suggested by www.fcm.ca ).The first group of regulatory changes to MGA which will come into force just prior to the election were widely discussed and feedback collected online around the issues of collaboration with indigenous communities, enforcement of ministerial orders, parental leave for municipal councillors, environmental stewardship and amalgamations and annexations, I am in agreement with the results/feedback and this agreement can be deemed an extension of my platform outlined in the 3 previous paragraphs. Details of the survey results can be reviewed @  https://mgareview.alberta.ca/wp‐content/upLoads/media/WWHContinuing‐the‐Conversation.pdfHopefully, I have demonstrated a reasonable grasp of issues , enough to earn your vote and those of youI will catch on my door‐knocking runs can grill me more at your door step."
Ward 5,Aryan Sadat,challenger,Aryan Sadat - Ward 5,"FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITYAs your Ward 5 Councillor, I will work with my colleagues on Council to make your tax dollars go to the things we need as a City and fight against reckless spending while our economy is declining. In 3 years, $7 million dollars has been spent on public art including $471,000 on the Blue Ring and $236,000 on an LED light installation on a NorthEast Water processing plant. While art is important to the community, we need to stop spending money because the current policy permits it; and we need to start focusing on local talent instead of international talent. $5 million was allocated to the Calgary Bid Exploration Committee (CBEC) just to report back to Council of a bid was feasible. Their report came back with a price tag of $50 million to bid and $4.6 billion to host. While some funding can come from the federal and provincial governments, it ultimately comes from the taxpayers. Council agreed to spend $7.1 million on a pilot project for bike lanes in the core at a time when Calgarians are losing jobs and the economy is suffering. That is a spend of $14 million of taxpayers money on wants for our city, not our needs. Line items I would have opposed as your Ward 5 Councillor. I will report quarterly to Calgarians as to what my office spends and commit to having among the lowest expenses of my colleagues. Being your Councillor is about representing you, our communities responsibly and with transparency.SAFER COMMUNITIESBuilding safer communities is not only about policing and fire halls that service Ward 5 but working with the City departments to create safer roads and intersections in our communities. Requesting Traffic Studies in areas where the established communities and the newer communities assure that we have safety for all our residentsAs Ward 5 continues to grow with newer communities being developed, I want to collaborate with established communities, their associations and Ward 5 residents to make sure that we have the right infrastructure, transportation routes and green spaces in place to maintain our quality of life in Ward 5. Growth for the sake of growth doesn't build our future, working with all stakeholders in Ward 5 as well as the City of Calgary so that we live in a dynamic City that is a destination to work, live and play."
Ward 5,Balraj (Raj) Nijjar,challenger,Balraj (Raj) Nijjar - Ward 5,"1.	Empowering and listening to the city employees: The front line workers are the ones that understand the most cost effective and efficient opportunities on the ground level when it comes to service delivery.The “one for all” service delivery approach is rigidly defined and needs revitalization.2.	Affordable housing: Ensure city continuously work with public and private partners and stakeholders to ensure a robust affordable house plan with a diversity of options. The developers must be engaged in policy making to ensure that certain percentage of the new housing is designated for affordable housing. All government agencies must be engaged to leverage their expertise and resources to initiate micro loan and flexible mortgage options for the low income groups. Work to alleviate waiting time for the most needy segment of the group.3.	Create accountability with measuring goals for City spending: I believe that the focus should not be solely on the dollars spent. Tax payers must also get the intended results and value for their dollars. The municipal governments must work towards service excellence by measuring and comparing performance.4.	Respect for Taxpayers money: Public must be engaged and consulted on major budget items. The taxpayers must be involved prior to the decision making rather than a way to justify decisions. Councillor must be accountable to the citizens and tax payers they represent.5.	Make communities and neighborhoods safer, healthier and stronger in Ward 5: At municipal level, we need to initiate community based research in the ethnically and professionally most diverse ward. The programs and services must be tailored to the needs of the Ward 5 constituents. The strong neighborhood initiatives must be taken after listening to local people with focus on revitalizing the neighborhoods. The initiatives must be designed to reflect the community’s desires, demographics and development interest.6.	Commitment to transparency to the community on the city council decision making process: I am committing to share information with the ward 5 residents about the decision making process at the city council. I also propose and support that city must keep a formal registry of all lobbyists at the city hall, and this registry must be made public. It will help restore public trust in the council further."
Ward 5,George Chahal,challenger,George Chahal - Ward 5,"I am the son of immigrant parents who worked hard to provide opportunities for me and my siblings to succeed. I am a strong proponent of investing in our youth, providing opportunities for our seniors and ensuring we are working to build a dynamic productive community. I believe in fiscal responsibility, reducing red tape and greater bylaw enforcement.Strong communities are a reflection of how we treat all parts of our community including new Calgarians, those who are less fortunate, seniors and small business owners. Businesses, community associations, cultural and religious groups have to work together to ensure prosperity as well as safe and clean communities. I believe in working with residents and communities to develop an affordable housing strategy as well as enhancing and developing recreational facilities.As a young diverse ward, our residents need opportunities to connect and collaborate through community building initiatives. I propose continuing the great work done at the Genesis Center by expanding the Centre to offer more programs for our growing communities but also begin the planning of a new North Calgary Recreation Center which brings residents of Ward 5 together. Opportunities for sports and recreation provide numerous health benefits but also teaches children important life skills such as; teamwork, self-confidence, public speaking, and leadership skills.Our ward has a high percentage of new Calgarians who either migrated from other parts of Canada or have immigrated to Canada. Calgarians come from many different socio-economic and cultural backgrounds. We need to listen, understand, and explain the shared Canadian values that bring us together. We need to ensure that all residents become part of the Canadian fabric and the local community. Diversity is the strength of our community, our country and we are stronger together.Our city is one of the main growth engines of the Canadian economy. Affordable housing, infrastructure, transit, and fiscal prudence are issues of importance to me. I do believe that we need to prioritize and balance expectations within a fiscal framework. Ultimately, we as taxpayers, will need to fund any increase in expenditures. I strongly believe that property and business tax increases should be held at the rate of inflation and any additional expenditures will need to be balanced by savings. Accordingly, whether we are looking at a new stadium for our professional sports team or a new Winter Olympics initiative; we must ensure that city council works within a fiscal framework that is in the interest of all Calgarians."
Ward 5,Hirde Jassal,challenger,Hirde Jassal - Ward 5,"TOWN HALL MEETINGS: The Town Hall Meetings are very important for ward‐5 residents as well as for myself. I am strongly committed to organize &amp; attend the Town Hall meetings in ward‐5 therefore the input of the constituents of ward‐5 could be delivered and shared with the City Council.YOUTH’S COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT: As a Provincial Director for Canadian Transplant Association, I am proud to say that I have a large team of volunteers which consists of both youth and adults. It would be one of my top priorities to have the youth engaged from ward‐5 in various community services; therefore, they can understand their responsibilities toward the society.SENIOR CITIZEN: Being the Director of the South Asian Canadian Association; which is a Senior Citizen registered society of Calgary, I understand the matters that affect the life of senior citizens. For example, language barrier leaves senior citizens facing with struggle to rebuild their lives &amp; it generates negative emotional &amp; cognitive responses. Use of a computer, how to answer the important phone calls from government authorities are the few big issues of senior citizens to adjust their life in the Canadian system. I will honestly support occasional workshops therefore the senior citizens can share their wealth of skills and experiences with the communities.LEGISLATION OF SECONDARY SUITE: A number of residents of ward‐5 want to rent out their basements either to boost their income &amp; help pay down their mortgage or providing accommodations for elderly parents. As a Councillor, my responsibility is to provide knowledge about a legal and safe basement suite.CELEBRATION OF CULTURAL FESTIVALS: Ward‐5 has a lot of diversity, and thus there are many different religious and cultural festivals in this ward. A strong input came in while door knocking that these all festivals could be celebrated together to understand each other’s cultural values. I support &amp; will continue to encourage this idea.INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS: The existing infrastructure requires renovation therefore this could attract residents of ward‐5 for the maximum use of these facilities. Being a Councillor I will try to get funding for this project ASAP.LAW &amp; ORDER; In these recent years, the crime rate and drug abuse have increased drastically. I want to organize workshops in ward‐5 frequently to raise awareness among the constituents especially the young generation about these growing issues.PROPERTY &amp; BUSINESS TAX: I have met many small business owners who want a good business tax policy and incentives to run their businesses for a long period of time. I will actively play my role on the basis of input from the constituents of ward‐5 before any year end amendments are made by the CityCouncil in the property &amp; business taxes.I have an honest understanding of the matters that affect our communities in ward‐5.

Ward 5,Tudor Dinca,challenger,Tudor Dinca - Ward 5,"This upcoming election will bring to Calgary’s most diverse area new ward boundaries. With this new layout come both some interesting challenges and opportunities.On the south side of the ward there are the established neighbourhoods of Castlerigde, Falconridge, Taradale, Martindale and Saddleridge. The greatest challenge to this part of the ward will be to rebuild and renew aging infrastructure. In order to achieve this, a new partnership between the City, individual owners and local businesses must take shape. An agreement that will afford citizens the tools to rebuild their communities in line with today’s standards.On the north side of the ward newer communities like Redstone, Skyview Ranch, Savanna, Cornerstone and Cityscape although at earlier stages in their development, lack many essential services, not least a police station and a community center; on the infrastructure side, the lack of funding for future LRT expansion being the most glaring omission by the City.Here is how I think we can address these challenges and make Ward 5 an even better place to live:1. Safe neighbourhood – while door knocking many of you told me how much you value your family’s safety.  This issue must be addressed; no person should feel unsafe when walking at night or fear for their child’s safety when him/her walk or bike in their neighbourhood. Safety is necessary to any healthy community, which is why I have placed this particular issue at the top of my platform.2. Freedom of choice – Our community would be better off if more people had more choices in how they got around – accessing school, work, recreation and other activities. More safe choices to move about the ward and around the city by car, transit, on bike or simply on foot will make our community more resilient and vibrant.3. Better public services – Services such as snow removal, maintenance of public spaces and lack of appropriate public lightning are concerns that have keep popping up at the door. This is for good reason as many corners of the NE have been neglected and fallen in disrepair.4. Sustainable urban planning  – For too long the city has developed based on a short sided vision, building new districts without access to basic services while allowing existing neighborhoods to decline.  If we want Calgary to thrive and maintain its position as a world class city, we must invest in more resilient models of community building.5. Community regeneration: The key to creative, safer, healthier communities is engaging our citizens on topics that are most important to them. More community participation and participatory budgeting is key not only for the NE but for the city at large.6. Smart spending – Every person aims to get the most out of their money so too should city hall. With every new project and contract, I will do my very best to make sure that our tax money is being spent with our ward’s and city’s best interest in mind."

Ward 6,Esmahan Razavi,challenger,Esmahan Razavi - Ward 6,"As a resident of Ward 6, you face an important choice on October 16th. This election will determine how we choose to forge a path ahead for our ward and for our city. The vision that I offer is built on the optimism and hope that is quintessential to being Calgarian. After months of conversations with Ward 6 residents and stakeholders, I have identified four themes that form the foundation of my platform: Strong Economy, World Class Infrastructure, Smart Development, and Safe Communities.Strong Economy: The state of Calgary’s economy is at the forefront of the minds of all Calgarians. Whether it is the stress of paying property taxes on our small business, the anxiety of being included in the next round of layoffs, or trying to put food on the table, not one of us has emerged unscathed from the economic downturn. Calgarians and Ward 6 residents value fiscal responsibility. Through providing economic relief for residents and small businesses, as well as encouraging innovation and advocating for a competitive business environment that draws in investors from all over the world, we can build a strong economy.World Class Infrastructure: For our economy to be competitive, we need to have world class infrastructure - the kind that makes our city a place where the best and brightest minds from all over the world want to come and live. We also need to maintain the infrastructure we have already invested in - like our roads and transit systems.Smart Development: Calgary is constantly attracting new residents and as a result, our city is growing. In 2016, Ward 6 was one of six wards in the city to see an increase in its population. This growth brings change as our ward and city adapt to the needs of our new community members. Smart development is needed to preserve what we love about our communities while accommodating the changes that come with increased density.Safe communities: Our neighbourhoods and communities serve as the building blocks of our city, province and country. They are the places we live in and for us to be able to enjoy them, we have to make sure that they are great environments for everyone. We care about our neighbourhoods and we want to make sure that they remain great places to raise our families, grow old, form friendships with our neighbours, and feel like we belong.Calgary is at its best and most successful when it looks to the future with hope, a desire for innovation and the belief that we are and will continue to be a vibrant land of opportunity. The platform I have put together reflects these values and the months of engagement that I have done with residents and stakeholders. Visit my website at www.esmahanrazavi.ca to read my full platform and discover why I’m the right choice for Ward 6."
Ward 6,Grace Nelson,challenger,Grace Nelson - Ward 6,"I am Grace Nelson, and I would like to convince you to vote for me for City Councillor - representing the communities in Ward 6 SW Calgary.To make this City work better, we all need to do our homework. Here is part of my plan.1.	Charity begins at home. Keep employment here before we seek other professionals and experts from outside our city. Let’s ensure we have given our homegrown talent a chance to work with us. Also, potential bidders should disclose to the public, the percentage of sourcing of local goods, materials and services.2.	Effective communication between businesses, City departments, and NeighbourhoodsResidents want to be more engaged in decision at planning and implementing stages of our infrastructure projects. Effective communication between stakeholders can avoid   disappointments and negative response to projects at approval and completion stages. Recent examples are: public art and sculpture, Seniors’ Associations, the South West Ring Road, more traffic lights, affordable housing, construction, secondary suites, direct light fixtures, traffic concerns, Parks and Recreation, public events draw. Let us know that clearly, we can do better.3.	Preserve the institutions that have made us unique.Our hospitals, the Saddledome, Olympics Training Facilities, museums and post-secondary institutions are just some of the institutions which shape our Calgary identity. Let’s maintain that friendly Western hospitality and show the world that we welcome diversity and inclusiveness. Visitors and new arrivals to our city make important contributions to our economy. We want to keep moving forward while ensuring we maintain our peaceful lifestyle.4.	Maintain Calgary as a resilient, prosperous and thriving CityOur frequent boom, flood, burn and bust cycles must not continue or we will lose the soul of the City. We need to be more resilient and diversified economically, so we don’t feel the pinch. Our empty business spaces need to be filled with businesses that can sell their services and products to an employed market. Lower taxes on small businesses and provide easy access to these establishments. We must make our transit system efficient.  Long travel times are unacceptable.  Residents should not have to pay high admission costs to visit the interactive Museums. We must have quick access to a Reserve Emergency fund when disaster hits and be well prepared for such events.5.	Encourage research and education initiativesAs we transition to an environmentally sustainable lifestyle, Calgary needs encouragement in research and education to make this possible and to create jobs in this City that I love. This includes implementing policies that encourage safe and affordable housing for all demographics.These ideas and suggestions were given to me by the thousands of households that I have visited over this campaign period.Let us continue to share our wisdom and our vision for Calgary.Go with Grace!"
Ward 6,Jeff Brownridge,challenger,Jeff Brownridge - Ward 6,"Leadership:One of the themes that you will find throughout my platform is responsible management of the finances of our city and the taxes that we collect. I am a firm believer that leadership needs to come from our elected officials and I will not vote for any salary increases in my first term as councilor if I am elected.I will also pledge to attend as many events and community association meetings as I can to help ensure that I am always listening to the concerns of the residents of Ward 6 and representing your views to our City Council.Fiscal Responsibility:Research by the Canadian Taxpayers Federation concluded Calgary’s property taxes increased almost three times the rate of inflation between 2005 and 2015. Research by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business shows that municipal spending in Calgary and Edmonton increased two and a half times faster than inflation and population growth between 2005 and 2015.I am pledging to keep our property tax increases as low as possible and I will strive for ways to deliver efficiency and eliminate wasteful and unnecessary spending.  Calgary is still a growing city that needs to balance the delivery of essential services, recreation, and a high quality of life with a responsible and accountable level of budgetary spending.Traffic and Congestion:Anyone that has lived in Ward 6 over the last decade knows that traffic and congestion are serious issues of concern.I will pledge to take a careful look at all development projects to ensure that any increases in density will be managed with transportation planning and infrastructure projects so that we are not impacted with further traffic and congestion issues.Transparency:The current City of Calgary Council spends more time than any other major city in Canada in meetings that are in camera. These meetings are closed to the public and members of the media.I will pledge to push for a reduction in the number of meetings that are being held under this veil of secrecy.Economic Development:In the ten years from 2002 to 2012, small businesses in Canada were responsible for 77.7% of all jobs created in the private sector; however, only half of new firms (51%) survive their fifth year of operation.Government policies and taxation at the Federal, Provincial and Municipal level can all have a significant impact on the ability for our businesses to thrive and succeed. Employment in Calgary has seen significant challenges during the current economic downturn and our city council can have a direct influence on the viability of the businesses that we create and the employment growth that these companies generate.I will pledge to find ways to support our local businesses so that they can be successful and continue to provide high quality employment opportunities."

Vancouver, Ottawa, Montreal &amp; Toronto teams built their own arenas ‐ so can Calgary.

Ward 7,Dean Brawn,challenger,Dean Brawn - Ward 7,"Dean wants to make Calgary the best city to raise a family, work, and have a business. Dean’s focus is jobs and the economy. With his business experience, he wants to work to make Calgary once again the business‐friendly city Calgarians are proud of, where people can succeed if they work hard. For that to happen, Dean will fight job‐killing taxes and wasteful spending we have suffered from City Hall in recent years. With lower taxes and more efficient management, Calgary can bring back jobs and be a more prosperous city.Dean has three major promises to make that happen:1. 	Bringing jobs back to our city and expanding the economy• 	Ensure Calgary is the best place to start a business in North America by cutting red tape and business taxes.2. 	Demanding City Hall respects taxpayers and delivers results• 	Taxes have gone up more than 50% in the past eight years – Calgarians have not seen a 50% improvement in services. Calgarians deserve value for their hard‐earned tax dollars. Councilors must stop wasteful spending on pet projects and self‐interests. We should put that money to good use and deliver tangible results for Calgarians.3. 	Protecting our seniors and our most vulnerable• 	Massive property tax increases in recent years have hurt fixed‐income Calgarians, including many seniors, the hardest. City Hall’s out‐of‐control tax hikes must stop, and Calgary must innovate and lead in affordable housing and social services."
Ward 7,Druh Farrell,incumbent,Druh Farrell - Ward 7,"IMAGINE A CALGARY THAT IS SUSTAINABLE, PROGRESSIVE, AND RESILIENT.This is my vision for our city. During my time on Calgary City Council, I have taken part in some incredible changes that moved us closer to that vision. It has been challenging at times to fight for these changes – and there is much more work to be done.I am proud of my record as your representative. From advocating for the economy through the Downtown Economic Summit, to curbside recycling, to flood mitigation, I deliver results for Ward 7 and for Calgary.Most recently, I’m proud to have delivered for the residents of Ward 7 by:‐ Fighting to eliminate sprawl subsidies to keep more tax dollars here‐ Spearheading recycling and the upcoming composting rollout‐ Keeping revenue generated in our Ward for community improvements‐ Supporting $45‐million in tax relief to small business for 2017I want to continue delivering results for you and I have the tenacity, vision, and energy to do so.Looking forward, my priorities are:Vibrant, Healthy NeighbourhoodsHealthy neighbourhoods are the building blocks of a great city. Druh will continue to work with communities to foster a sense of belonging, pride, and connection. From small projects like pop‐up patios and accessible playgrounds to large investments in community arenas, parks, and outdoor pools, Druh helps communities become engaged, resilient, and more prosperous. Druh helps residents spread good ideas for neighbourhoods that are accessible for all ages and abilities.Safe StreetsInner city neighbourhoods face constant cut‐through traffic and pedestrian safety is a top issue. Druh delivered Step Forward, Calgary’s first‐ever pedestrian strategy. Druh will continue to seek both quick wins and major improvements for safe, friendly streets.Smart DevelopmentNew development delivers investment and new families to established Ward 7 communities; it can also bring challenges. Druh will continue to strive for high quality development that fits into the neighbourhood and enhances community amenities.Complete Flood MitigationSince the 2013 flood, Druh has led the effort to deliver crucial upstream prevention and flood mitigation for our river communities. Druh will work tirelessly to ensure flood protection and drainage projects are completed.Ask The Tough QuestionsMegaprojects must provide financial accountability. The Olympics or sports arenas are highly profitable businesses that often transfer financial risks to citizens. Druh will continue to ask tough questions around debt and tax impacts, risk versus reward, and public benefit of such projects.On October 16th, Druh is once again asking for your support. Ward 7 needs a strong, visionary voice on Council to continue to thrive. We need Druh Farrell."
Ward 7,Marek Hejduk,challenger,Marek Hejduk - Ward 7,"1.	Accountability and Common SenseIf we look at city halls track record, notably in the last 8 years we’ve seen a shift from politics of the people to politics of the egos, corporations and special interest groups.  That has resulted in economical disasters.  In all cases there is a distinct lack of public input, accountability by the City of Calgary and common sense.  Instead of just talking about the problems Marek Hejduk is proposing some solutions with any public input welcome.  Unless we reverse the course holding our public officials accountable to the people who are voting for them we will see higher taxes, more boondoggles, and egoist spending on vanity projects inside city limits.2. Secondary Suites in the CityMarek Hejduk would propose an office that handles secondary suites that includes home inspectors to ensure that the secondary suites are up to fire and safety code as well as monitoring and accordingly charging rental units that wish to become Airbnb hotels.3. Olympic BidThere is a lot of controversy around the Olympic bid.  We also have to face a few economic facts; is this really the time to spend money and get farther into debt with rising interest rates, low oil prices with no recovery on the horizon, a higher than national average unemployment rate and skyrocketing cost of living.  Things may well recover in the future, for now we should let the Olympic bid lie until we are all financially and emotionally prepared for it.4. Re-examine the Fluoride IssueThe decision to reinstate fluoridation has the potential to unite Calgarians regarding our common desire to everyone enjoy good health."

Ward 8,Carter Thomson,challenger,Carter Thomson - Ward 8,My number one priority will be to provide my very best  to give you the taxpayer the help you deserve with any problem you have. High on my list will be to address problems with safety in our city. The present opiod crisis has been very challenging to our civic resources. My office will engage with appropriate departments and answer to you THE CITIZEN. I pledge to have my electronic devices turned to airplane mode during meetings. You may rest assured that I will not be part of the Distracted Administration. I pledge to not squander your tax dollars . I will always strive to get the best bang for YOUR buck. I will not be absent when the chips are down and tough questions need to be answered.
Ward 8,Chris Davis,challenger,Chris Davis - Ward 8,"VALUE FOR TAXESI will treat Calgarian’s tax dollars with respect, cut wasteful spending, slow the rate of growth on new spending, and look for ways to improve core services without hiking taxes on Calgary families.I understand the importance of a tax program that not only delivers quality services from our local government, but that prioritizes responsible spending and keeps life affordable for hard‐working Calgarians.SUPPORTING SMALL BUSINESSI will stand up for small businesses in Calgary. I will ensure we see the elimination of business taxes, reduce burdensome red tape, and make Calgary the best city in Canada to start and grow a new business.I support Calgary’s business improvement areas (BIAs) and their important role in promoting their members’ businesses and attracting Calgarians to their districts.  I will not support any new initiatives by City Council to manage or control these independently funded and managed organizations.TRUST &amp; ACCOUNTABILITYI will work to rebuild trust between City Council and everyday Calgarians, throw open the doors of City Hall, and work with a new generation of municipal leadership to stamp out a culture of entitlement that has taken hold at City Hall.I will support the elimination of texting and smart phone use during public hearings of City Council. I will move to get public business back in front of the public, with the elimination of closed door meetings for all matters other than personnel items and sensitive contractual issues.I will ask that Council review its governance role on many of the boards, committees and commissions where it currently has representation or membership.  Independent oversight of these agencies may be compromised by this continued direct participation by Council or its members.SENSIBLE DEVELOPMENTWith over 27 years of municipal development experience, I know that local communities are best positioned to provide meaningful input on what kind of development is right for their neighbourhoods. While Council has to make the final decision on land use matters, I will reform the local consultation process so that it puts neighbourhoods first. Recognizing that all cities must evolve, planning of cities should not be all “top down” ‐ it should be a collaborative process where the local citizens’ voices matter.MOVING CALGARY FORWARDCalgary and Calgarians have a history of rebounding from setbacks.  The downturns following the Turner Valley boom in 1914 and the doldrums of the mid‐20th Century were followed by periods of tremendous growth.  We may not see a similar dramatic turnaround over the next four years, but we must take steps to prepare for it.  The current 30+ per cent downtown vacancy rates and abundance of residential housing are an opportunity for growth. Calgarians need experienced and visionary leadership for the next four years."

And, I view that it is not the City’s role or responsibility to help promote election candidates by spending taxpayer dollars.I will be instead recording my own 2‐minute video for my own personal promotion of my campaign.  Please keep in mind that I am funding and promoting my campaign without having to spend any taxpayer money!Come view my video on my homepage at karlacharest.com.Over the course of exploring the many issues that Calgarians have expressed concerns about, I have worked on developing a policy focus for these Ward 8 priorities:Reduce the Property Tax BurdenOver the past 10 years residential property taxes have increased 55% and business property taxes 180%.  Fair measures are needed to reduce the tax burden on homeowners and small businesses.  Lower taxes will benefit all taxpayers.Keep Housing AffordableCurrent City planning and restrictive land‐use policies are making housing more expensive to purchase and to be able to remain living in.  These crippling policies need to be changed. My proposed changes will result in a positive benefit for everyone.Respect for Mature Neighbourhood’s CharacterCalgary plans to accommodate approximately 120,000 new residents in existing mature communities by 2039.  The City wants mature neighbourhoods to absorb newcomers through an aggressive densification program.  Through enhanced participation and collaboration of residents, my office will ensure that the voices in every community will be heard to support the character, integrity and safety of Calgary’s neighbourhoods.In addition to these three key priorities, I also have detailed platform positions on:Respect, Transparency and Accountability – The City of Calgary and the City Council need to overhaul their cavalier attitudes and become transparent and accountable for their actions.Efficient Delivery of Core Services – Money spent on core services needs to be targeted and earmarked for the maximum benefit of all Calgarians.Developing and Building a City Focused Entrepreneurial Friendly Playbook –The City of Calgary must adopt innovative solutions to enable growth and development in an economically sustainable manner.Digital Transformation to Ensure Calgary’s Prosperity – A sustainable future for local government depends on changing Calgary’s traditional centralized and compartmentalized bureaucracies. Solutions to Minimize Increasing Wage Spending – If the City is to focus on a new entrepreneurial friendly playbook to ensure Calgary’s future success, then a wage spending solution will be required if any hope of resilience is to be achieved within City Hall.Thank you for visiting my profile page.

Ward 9,Boss Madimba,challenger,Boss Madimba - Ward 9,"Hi, I’m Boss Madimba and I am your candidate for Ward 9. I believe that we have fundamentally weak communication between communities and the City Hall. It is clear from constituent’s feedback that the present effort and strategies are not good enough. I will work hard to build and strengthen that communication.The geo-political security situation over the world has become precarious. We cannot let our guard down and making Calgary a safer city is my top priority. This will require input from all communities with strong leaders to represent them at City Hall.Corruption of all kinds has been plaguing our society. This, along with wasteful expenditure must stop. I will fight vigorously to curb the waste and increase accountability.The balance between business’ and homes are the cornerstone of a successful, thriving development and taxation must be fair and justified. I will ensure that this will be done equitably and with a friendly, inclusive approach. The City of Calgary has increased taxes where I believe more funding should come from other levels of government. City councillors are using property dollars to pay for things that the provincial and federal government should be responsible for. One area of focus will be to shift the financial burden to higher levels of government.I think it is time to stop talking and start demonstrating from a leadership prospective that we are not only listening but we’re are actually hearing what Calgarians have to say and understand what Calgarians needs are. I think that what we are lacking right now is a better understanding of the actual needs of the city and its citizens rather than wasteful spending on controversial “art”.Cities grow and evolve based on resources, support, opportunities’ and development. Smart, dynamic, innovative and futurist’s ideas will ensure that our city of Calgary will always stays at the top and flourish. We cannot live in the past, bright ideas will help in a consistent growth of the people and communities. I will dedicate all my energies toward these goals.Calgary should be governed by Calgarians and those who feel passionate about their future.Among my top priorities will be to implement your ideas and plans for a bright future that continue to place Calgary among the top livable cities in the world year after year."
Ward 9,Cesar Saavedra,challenger,Cesar Saavedra - Ward 9,"My platform is based on three fundamental principles for improvements to the Ward 9 communities.They are; Improvements to our dated infrastructure, safety initiatives that also include the Calgary Police Service (CPS) and the Calgary Fire Department (CFD), and foment a healthy and engaged society through diverse recreation programs for all ages. I believe that addressing these three issues will result in more engaged and prosperous communities that feel connected to our city.The Ward 9 communities deserve to be as dynamic as any other part of Calgary, for this to be possible there needs to be a considerable update to key landmarks in our neighborhoods and create ones where now none exist. Things such as community name signage, well-kept lawns and recreational areas all add to the well-being of our constituent’s day to day experience. This also pertains to the aesthetic level of our local businesses’ areas, I aim to work with owners and developers alike to locate appropriate improvements to public and private infrastructure that pertains to municipal jurisdiction, and greater works through provincial funding.All these improvements must come with a level of safety, for property and more importantly to the people that will make use of new areas and drive the economy of existing and emerging businesses. Communities have to work with the CPS and CFD, to drive home the fact that they are there to serve our needs in terms of safety, as the professionals that they are. Residents should feel protected and the municipality has to work to make sure that a level of trust is built for and felt by residents. I aim to develop neighborhood activities, safety fairs and other mediums in which to achieve this. I believe that this will help reduce and prevent crime and other kinds of violence.Last but not least, I believe that a healthy society, of mind and of body, is one that can create great things. For this reason, I believe that we should take our community involvement seriously, to offer a variety of programs that will incite constituents to participate, be it sport tournaments or art events and programs. This can also include partnerships with schools and the Calgary Board of Education (CBE). We have a very diverse multicultural human capital in our neighborhoods, and we should connect with all of them, to bring people close together and participate in fun and fulfilling projects. This will also open a flood of community leadership and creativity that can only lead to make our neighborhoods vibrant and find its own voice within the city.Councillors have a duty to represent their electorate and the municipality itself, they should be held to the highest accountability. Regardless of where one lives, residents are to be respected, and deserve to be considered, to be included in the development of THEIR city. This is why I’m running for Councillor, being aware of the responsibility it demands, to uphold the pledge of working for the people."

Ward 9,Gian-Carlo Carra,incumbent,Gian-Carlo Carra - Ward 9,"The focus of my life—through 10 years of professional practice in sustainable urban design, as a deeply committed volunteer in East Calgary’s communities and over the last seven years at City Hall as Ward 9’s Councillor—has been all about our neighbourhoods.In my first campaign, I ran on the platform of Neighbourhoods First—putting our Ward 9 communities and the people that live and work here at the forefront of what we do at City Hall. After three successful years of changing hearts and minds and beginning the process of overhauling our municipality’s rules, regulations and processes, I refined my focus to Great Neighbourhoods—a five‐point transformation of the direction and structure of our municipal government.At the centre of this work is the understanding that Great Neighbourhoods make a great city.I believe this idea has never been more important than it is today. As people fleeing hatred and strife look to Canada, and Calgary, as a beacon of safety and opportunity in a stormy world; as our city’s core industry ‐ oil and gas ‐ faces a structural change and the long‐discussed ideal of economic diversification has become a pressing need on which our future survival and success depends; and as we realize, along with cities across North America, that the kind of city we’ve spent the last several decades building presents significant challenges to our environment, to our ability to care for one another effectively, to our health and to our financial future—Great Neighbourhoods is a collective project of city‐building that mitigates our existing risks and embraces the amazing opportunities that Calgary’s considerable strengths put within our reach.As Calgary sits at these crossroads, I believe the neighbourhoods of East Calgary embody a different and better path forward. While our City has never been more diverse than it is today, too often people who come from the same backgrounds, who make the same amount of money, who believe the exact same things, choose to live apart from everyone else in their own cul‐de‐sacs and enclaves.East Calgary is different.In East Calgary, all the people of Calgary live together in diverse neighbourhoods, close to where we work and shop and learn and worship and play. It is in East Calgary that the community we build together will reflect the best promises of Great Neighbourhoods.I’m extremely proud of the progress we’ve made towards Great Neighbourhoods over the last seven years and I’m deeply excited by the opportunity to continue this work representing a unified East Calgary within Ward 9."
Ward 9,Omar M'keyo,challenger,Omar M'keyo - Ward 9,"A vote for Omar on October 16th, 2017 is a vote for,A special tax for Ward 9.I am going to work every day to make sure that the council vote on a special tax for property and small business owners located in Ward 9. It is not right to make these people pay the same level of taxes while they face constant risks. The level of risk and insecurity makes it harder to make any viable profit from a business perspective. Properties lose value due to high level of crime and insecurity. The special tax intends to bring more investors while maintaining those who are already here and keep those jobs we so need. The more business we bring or keep in the area can lead to the gentrification of the area.A free daycare program.Giving free day care to low income families, working poor, single parents (man or a woman) and those who want to go to school but who happen to have a child or children make sense not only economically but also socially if we need to lift up people out of poverty.A job program for vulnerable.All city contractors will be required to set aside a certain % of its labor force for homeless people who want and are able to work.A secure Neighborhood.SE Calgary has been ignored for too long. We need to work with all classes of people, from church leaders, community heads, community association presidents, local organizations and any other stakeholders that is affected by crime and insecurity in SE Calgary to sit down and share ideas and develop strategy that will make sure SE Calgary is safe like any other area in Calgary. We can’t keep relying on traditional means to solve our problems.A community based approach to solve problems.We will start dealing with problems at the community level instead of the common lip service we see every day from our current councilor. They pretend to consult us but in the end decision are taken in corporate offices in downtown Calgary.A sound educational program that reaches every child.With educational organizations, including Calgary Library, we are going to improve on existing programs to make sure that no child is left behind when it comes to tutoring program. We may require sending qualified high, college or University students to go house to house where children live and tutor them from their own houses. This will also lead to part time job opportunities for students.Affordable housing for all.This is an ongoing issue. The council need to be serious and that is what I intend to do, fighting for more affordable housing for those who need them.Social infrastructures for all.Our social infrastructures are old and obsolete. Our parks need major upgrading.Erect a counseling centre for all.A well funded counseling centre is needed in Ward 9 to make sure those who need this crucial service get it. Many of our youths need this service."
Ward 9,Trevor Buckler,challenger,Trevor Buckler - Ward 9,"My Platform statement is Required Versus Desired! We take care of our needs before we go after our wants, treat the city budget as if was our home budget.( you don't by a hot tub before you pay the food bill)I feel the current administration is dysfunctional and has zero ability to manage our tax dollars. They can not make a decision without hiring a consultant or forming a committee to eliminate their responsibility for their waste of tax dollars.I am a fiscal conservative, I am not a politician . I will not be a virtue signalling social justice warrior and I am not politically correct.The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different result. If you want different results vote to change the face of city council!"
Ward 10,David Winkler,challenger,David Winkler - Ward 10,"1.	Assist Calgary’s economic recovery by speeding up the time for planning and licensingOur businesses have been struggling with tax rates that are among the highest in the country and an ever increasing wait times for planning and development approvals. Costing businesses time, money and stress while losing out on opportunities. There is a huge disconnect between City Hall and small business. I will ensure City Hall understands the importance to completing applications much more quickly so that our businesses can activate their companies faster.2.	Reassess the use of Public SpacesIn many of the communities throughout our city, the Community Associations (CA’s) are struggling to attract new volunteers, support existing ones, and keep the community halls in good condition. I would like to reassess the uses of our CA Halls and engage the community to determine their best use. It is imperative that we respect and focus on the needs of our more culturally diverse communities.  Ward 10 has has changed culturally and many CA’s have been unable to keep pace with that change.3.	Fix the 36th Street corridorThe City has created an absolute disaster of transportation infrastructure along the 36 Street corridor. We need a complete redesign and rework in its entirety from Memorial Drive to McKnight Boulevard. I will engage stakeholders, to improve the corridor. I am the Councillor that can make partnerships that will be able to realistically develop the corridor to be a shining example of community supported development.4.	Community support for our youth:Encouraging our youth to use public spaces contributes to a healthy community. Bringing our youth together in a healthy and active ways also promotes more eyes on our streets leading to safer communities. We need a large component of recreational and cultural programming to be centred around supporting our youth.5.	Business Improvement AreasI will be proposing the idea of a commercial and industrial “Business Improvement Areas” (BIA). The benefits of the communities levying themselves and retaining all of their business taxes will benefit them immediately and provide the flexibility they need to decide where their resources are best utilized. Also, serving to create safer and more beautiful spaces.6.  Term LimitsI want to change to our current election policies to support a limit of 3 terms as Councillor or Mayor. I feel that it is important that Calgary continues to have new energy and new ideas on Council. In most cases there seems to be a lack of enthusiasm/engagement of Councillors that have been in Council for over 3 terms.7.   Open opportunities to develop residential in commercial and industrial districts⅓ of Ward 10 is comprised of solely commercial and industrial lands. I would propose that we allow the opportunity of residential developments in many of these areas where possible. This is an outdated ideology that needs to be challenged"

Ward 10,Gar Gar,challenger,Gar Gar - Ward 10,"I believe that we all want the same thing…to live in a thriving city that makes us proud, one that gives us and our children opportunities to be successful.At age 17, Calgary gave me the opportunity to go from a refugee with no home, nor English language, to a graduate in business and president of SAITSA.But today, the next generation is missing out on those opportunities that our City gave me.For young families and individuals on average incomes, housing has increasingly become unaffordable. Home ownership has even become a nightmare with increasing in property taxes. But worse, there is no break on the additional fees such as the Green Cart Food Waste and its bags on top of the bills and Taxes that households already paying.For small businesses and entrepreneurs in North East Calgary, suffering has been the norm through this economic downturn and struggling to keep their doors open with the unnecessary red tapes and increases in taxes.We cannot afford to price ordinary, working Calgarians out of our city.•	My first priority will be making North East Calgary safer and more secure for residents and businesses. I vow that our residents will not have to install sensors to our front doors or keep our porch lights on to feel safe. I also vow to ensure that our communities amnesties are well kept.•	I will advocate on safer pedestrian crossings for our children and seniors in every North East Calgary Street. I vow that our most vulnerable will not be victims to near-miss incidents. I will ensure that our burned streets lights are replaced on time and streets signs are not blocked by trees.•	I will be the most pro-business councillor. Not just because of my education in business, but because I know that a prosperous, growing economy is central to ensuring that our city remains a place of opportunity, for employers and employees.  I will stand alongside business owners in campaigning against the red tape and the rigorous processes to encourage entrepreneurship.•	I will tackle the affordable housing crisis. We do not need to only build more affordable homes, we need to ensure that the current ones are maintained, and the people living in these homes have the means to maintain them. We need to also allow opportunities to home owners to provide affordable places such as secondary suits. I have a plan that will eliminate inflated housing prices, and transition low-income home owners to middle-income housing.North East Calgary has what it takes to drive success. But first, our nieghbourhoods need a City that works for all and a leader that is taught on issues and getting things done.I have a deep understanding of what it means to feel unsafe in our own homes. I’ve experienced poverty and lack of opportunity. I will fight to make our communities safe, keep them clean and bring opportunity and affordability.On October 16, Vote Gar Gar to get things done."

Ward 10,Kamilla Prasad,challenger,Kamilla Prasad - Ward 10,"I am a Calgarian, I love my City and my Community. Every decision I make on Council will be guided by a simple principle Consider People First….Consider Canadian Citizens FirstFREEZE PROPERTY &amp; BUSINESS TAXESFreezing property &amp; business taxes for 5-10 years or until economy recovers will help business &amp; residence owners affected by the drop in our City’s economy. Until our City has new business plans to help rebuild our City’s economy focusing on different types of business and industries that will grow rapidly within the next 5-10 years.REDUCE CRIME TO CREATE SAFE &amp; SECURE COMMUNITIESHiring security guards with patrol vehicles costs less &amp; will create more employments. Hiring more police officers in Calgary &amp; NE as the City adopts the legalization of marijuana use. Community halls be used for youth oriented programs; drop in centers with multicultural programs to help develop new talents &amp; healthier lifestyles.SAFER PEDESTRIAN CROSSINGC-Train crossings need automatic interlocking gates installed immediately to avoid further accidental deaths. New flashing lights with barricade bars vertical &amp; horizontal need to be installed to avoid traffic driving into oncoming trains. New pedestrian cross walks need to be painted by every mailbox for safe &amp; easy accessibility.BALANCED COMMUNITY PLANSBuilding 200 units in Martindale increases lower income population in NE. All future developments &amp; upgrades should be up to the beltline level. The future East Stony Area Structure Plan which includes approximately 225 acres of undeveloped land in NE Calgary, east of Stoney Trail should increase the development standard to beltline. Which will able the residences &amp; business owners with school age children to drop &amp; pick children from school. NE &amp; surrounding area residence will be employed closer to home &amp; encourages fewer vehicles on our streets.36 STREET TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTUREA safer redesigning &amp; structure is needed to accommodate the growing population of drivers, bikers &amp; pedestrians. Residences use the LRT to commute to work in evenings &amp; in winter walk home or to nearby bus stops. Daily commute is a reality for most residence of Ward 10. The City of Calgary needs to ensure adequate planning for our future transportation needs by improving public transportation &amp; road planning. Our communities can be made more walkable &amp; safe through more proactive assessment of the needs of the community &amp; the increase use of cross walks &amp; street lights.AFFORDABLE ASSISTED LIVINGSeniors are our growing population in Ward 10.  City of Calgary needs to encourage stakeholders &amp; business owners to invest in senior assisted living homes in NE. Many of our seniors are forced to move into senior homes away from their close families &amp; friends. It becomes difficult for families and friends to frequently visit their loved ones  living in different quadrants and cities."
Ward 10,Michelle Robinson,challenger,Michelle Robinson - Ward 10,"Community Inclusion Safety LeadershipDEMOCRACY: I am a concerned citizen, just like you. I strongly believe in a healthy democracy and have been involved in politics in Ward 10 since 2011. I have held positions from secretary to president, in different electoral riding associations at both provincial and federal levels. I have submitted and passed policies within the current democratic structure for our areas. I ask leaders in our area if they would consider running - youth, women and people of marginalized communities. I was a Samara Canada 2015 Everyday Political Citizen nominee and understand where and why there are gaps of Indigenous inclusion and used that experience to advocate for other communities outside of the Indigenous so that everyone is included.SAFETY: A lack of safety can mean anything from cat-calling, to traffic lights, signs and signals, car accidents, natural disasters, or just being able to safely walk to a bus stop after a snowfall. While safety means different things to different people, it also means having a child be able to safely ride their bike to pools or libraries, and not struggling with roads, transit and a stroller. I have been part of Community Action Team Walks – CAT Walks, that include bylaw and police officers where volunteers can ask questions and learn in a setting of non-emergency to increase community pride, decrease crime, and to get to know neighbours. I was introduced to concepts of safety and crime prevention through environmental design through organizations like Safegrowth (trademarked) that realize community led initiatives. I attended harm reduction meetings which brought many groups to the table to see where we have commonalities to solve issues in positive, constructive ways. I was able to talk about intergenerational traumas and bring solutions to the table informed by my individual Indigenous perspective. As a community organizer of vigils for Indigenous peoples’ in our area, I see these issues with a broader perspective.INCLUSION:  I believe inclusion is related to safety. I have family that identify as part of the LGBTQ2+ communities. I see the homophobia and transphobia hurt others. I see how the Indian Residential School taught bullying and put many youth today at risk for homelessness and add to the issue of missing and murdered Indigenous people. With poverty reduction, an Indigenous lens is needed to tackle issues of long standing history and I want to implement solutions.INFRASTRUCTURE: Having been part owner in a geomatics supply business and working in the city, I knew how limited our choices were getting to work. These are infrastructure issues in an established area that could be looked at with community outreach that works for all. I’m uniquely qualified to be in a position of governance as we tackle secondary suite issues.  Teamwork will be key."
Ward 10,Najeeb Butt,challenger,Najeeb Butt - Ward 10,"As your Councilor if elected I will focus on due diligence issues and activities specific to all those matters that may affect our citizen’s day to day residential practices which includes but is not limited to:1.	Fair property assessment to reduce property taxes for both residential and commercial properties.2.	More recreational facilities and programs for our seniors, youth, woman, children, and citizens with special needs.3.	Timely snow and trash removal and Improved Calgary transit and road planning.4.	Creating recycling awareness to save our environment with focus on risk free projects.5.	Holding public hearings on all by‐laws specifically on public safety, fire department, Calgary police, and land use by laws.6.	I will support a new amendment that prohibits anyone from being elected for a third term to the city council and I will not support the increase of council wages.7.	My ultimate goal is to be involved with the public to run this ward under residence strategies.My vision is a vibrant community with sustainable development for all residents of my ward.

Ward 10,Ray Jones,incumbent,Ray Jones - Ward 10,"My name is Ray Jones, I currently hold office on City Council for Ward 5 and I am seeking re-election for the newly formed Ward 10 office on October 16,2017.  Over the past four years I have heard from many of the residents and some of their concerns are included in my platform:  Community Development, Safety &amp; Transportation, Affordable Housing and lastly Accountability.1.	Community DevelopmentI will continue to enhance our communities and increase community pride with programs such as: The Annual Ward Community Cleanup, Rundle Area Master Plan and Legacy Parks. I am currently, investigating the installation of artificial turf in a centrally located area within ward 10 for a multipurpose field to be used by all ages.2.	Safety &amp; TransportationI support cost effective public transit and the enhancement of neighborhood community policing to ensure the safety and enjoyment of all our neighborhoods for our residents and businesses.  I will insist on the continuation of investments into our LRT service, station upgrades and ongoing monitoring of effective use of bus routes. I will continue to support communities and their residents with the Community Resource police staff at District 4 and 5 Police Stations.3.	Affordable HousingI will maintain my support for affordable housing such as Habitat for Humanity, Senior's low-cost housing and secondary suite reform. Our population is aging, both in the smaller communities and throughout the city, we need to be able to readily meet their needs at an affordable price.  As well, i believe we need to develop a system that addresses secondary suites as an effective way to increase affordable units for low income families and individuals.4.	AccountabilityI'm determined to keep City spending restrained, city resources and facilities utilized effectively and spending warranted, meeting the needs of Calgarians.  Over the past 24 years, I've consistently been below my allocated ward budget and have returned funds back to The City year after year.  I believe in fiscal responsibility of The City and will revisit their budgets to keep them on track again in the Fall. On a personal note, I will continue to listen to your concerns, take action on your behalf to resolve your issues and will continue to collaborate with your community association leaders.In the past years of serving on City Council, I have seen the booms and the busts and with the recent downturn in our economy it is more important now than ever for Council to work collaboratively and to have meaningful consultations with the development industry and to liaise between them and civic administration. We should be working together to achieve the same goals of building a great and vibrant city."

We have lovely homes, beautiful gardens and trees, great public spaces and, most importantly, welcoming and supportive neighbours. However, we need political leadership that will champion strong infrastructure and smart urban design policies that support our safety.It’s time to make sure we all feel safe wherever we may be in the northeast. I am ready to work with community, businesses, the police and city administration on ending these challenges through smarter use of our current systems, data and technology.  We are safer when we are together, when we know each other and when we activity explore and use our environment.Here are areas where we can act:One. Stronger lighting and monitoring. We need stronger investments in lighting up and monitoring our LRT platforms, bus stops, pathways and some back alleys.Two. Stronger activation of commercial areas.  We need stronger partnerships so we can activate our large commercial areas and the smaller plazas in our residential communities with continuous community, culture and business activity.Three. We need safer roads. In some areas we need to slow down traffic and in some areas we need to get people, cars, bikes, buses and trains moving with much more efficiency and safety.I am ready to work on stronger lighting and monitoring, smarter use of our public and commercial spaces and safer roads.B.

It’s time to support our local business community through smarter partnerships and stronger infrastructure.Here are some areas where we can act.One. Stronger infrastructure that supports business activity. We need smarter infrastructure that supports encouraging people to spend time in and around our commercial areas. Smarter infrastructure means more effective transit, safer traffic flows and better walkability including sidewalks and pathways for all our commercial areas.Two. Stronger activation of our commercial areas. We need to renew and reactivate our commercial areas with stronger partnerships that integrate community, art and culture and even urban farming into our business areas.

Thriving neighbourhoods:  If we work together, we can go further in achieving thriving neighbourhoods.  I commit to establishing open lines of communication and accessibility so the office of Ward 11 can work hand‐in‐hand with community associations, businesses, organizations and engaged citizens to understand and respond to the needs of residents.  I support:∙  Good walkability and proximity to commercial centres, community assets and recreation spaces∙  Neighbourhoods of diversity; with a range of density, activity, and ways to get around∙  Resilient communities that withstand demographic changes with well‐attended schools and safe streets for our kids to play∙  Secondary suites and low‐rise densification, but with significant room for improvement and efficiency in the application, design and approval process∙  Approaches to keep community members engaged, active and in their homes through initiatives such as the Age‐friendly strategy, Community Hubs, cycle tracks and before‐ and after‐school programs2.	Supports for Families and Communities: Our whole city will be better off socially and economically if we put people and communities first; invest in families; and make sure the voices of the most marginalized Calgarians are heard. As your Councillor, I will:∙  Champion the non‐profit sector in Calgary, building on many years of collaboration and relationshipbuilding∙  Advocate for increases to Family and Community Support Services∙  Continue in my work to enhance the municipal system of Early Learning and Child Care∙  Work closely with the many stakeholders in the private, non‐profit and public sectors who provide affordable housing in our city∙  Take a rights‐based approach to decision‐making and commit to meaningful engagement with user groups, the voice of lived experience and subject matter experts to ensure all perspectives are heard.3.	A city our kids can be proud of: I want City Hall to show courage and leadership and make some tough choices that will lead to a vibrant urban centre in the 21st century and beyond. I want Calgary to be a well‐maintained city that is fiscally prudent, environmentally conscious, and socially‐minded.  To achieve the city I want for future generations, I will:∙  Advocate for a robust, convenient public transit, pathway and cycle track system∙  Support plans that look ahead to the changing nature of work, autonomous vehicles and the sharing economy∙  Foster a respected, adequately resourced Administration, including Community Standards, Police and Fire Services, that delivers world‐class service to Calgarians∙  Assist in establishing unprecedented nation‐to‐nation relations with members of the First Nations, Metis and Inuit communities∙  Champion diversity of City committees, boards and Council so they are reflective of the populations they represent"
Ward 11,Jeromy Farkas,challenger,Jeromy Farkas - Ward 11,"Jeromy’s priority for Ward 11 will be to keep Calgary competitive, cut red tape, and hold the line on property taxes so that small businesses can do what they do best: power our economy, create jobs, and contribute to our communities.Jeromy is the only Ward 11 candidate who will move to stop the Southwest BRT, a project which will hurt rather than help. Good government should know when to serve, and when to get out of the way. Jeromy will champion a smaller and more focused City Hall that puts the needs of everyday Calgarians – and not the elites and special interests – first. Jeromy strongly believes that it’s time to end the culture of entitlement and secrecy that has taken hold of City Hall.He’s closely tracked the City of Calgary’s successes and failures, and broken national stories such as Council’s time spent in secret, their lavish perks, and overall attendance. He has spent the last two years asking Calgarians what they need from their municipal representative and will continue to be as available for the residents he seeks to represent.From burdensome regulations and business taxes that put Calgary small businesses at a competitive disadvantage when compared to other jurisdictions, to massive property tax hikes that have priced seniors out of their real estate, City Hall is hurting families when they can least afford it. With a transparent and accountable City Hall that once again serves Calgarian families and entrepreneurs, Calgary will retake its place as an economic engine of Canada.Calgarians are the most innovative and creative people on the planet, and our entrepreneurs reflect this same spirit of ingenuity. What they need is a willing partner at City Hall who will stand up for those who work hard and pay their taxes, and make Calgary the best place to do business not just in Alberta, but in North America.He believes Calgary is the best city to live and work in in this country, and he hopes to serve its residents to keep it that way."
Ward 11,Keith Simmons,challenger,Keith Simmons - Ward 11,"Keith Simmons - Works for Calgary, Works for You!Who is Keith?Community - Strength in community means understanding where we all fit in – it’s often a more difficult path, but creates a place where we can all be safe, at home and proud of where we live.Equitable - I want to represent all residents, not just those who are connected. It’s important that we have advocates for issues, but also that we all get the chance to contribute.Problem Solver - It’s crucial that we find the root cause of an issue and quit working on symptoms. We need well moderated decisions so we can move forward in a direction that benefits everyone affected.Collaborative - Calgary and its City Hall has a very diverse set of strengths. No one person, group or department has all the answers, but many have strength in a particular realm. Being able to pull together strengths leads to better, more cohesive outcomes.Value - We need to see the value at City Hall. Creating better interaction with citizens and increased awareness of City strengths, along with increased communication, will help us be more confident stakeholders of City Hall.My take on some issues facing Calgarians today.1. Residential street safety/livability - In a number of places in our older Ward 11 communities, it is very easy for the car to be a nuisance (and a hazard) to the people in their homes. We need to place more emphasis on the livability of the residents.2. Seniors Issues - Today’s Calgary evolved from extreme rapid growth and wasn’t planned for a balanced demographic. Our senior population continues to grow and we need to consider all generations in future plans.3. Secondary suites – Secondary suites is more than just a rezoning conversation, we can diminish poorly-executed suites with a solid licensing process that includes the home owner and neighbours.Note: If it's your kids, your parents or a renter - suite or no - it needs to be safe.4. Transit - We need more mobility options in Calgary, and transit is a good way to achieve that, but we need to be smart about its placement, for catchment and possible evolution (LRT possibilities).5. Bike Infrastructure – I believe in giving people a chance to make healthy mobility choices. Riding a bike in Calgary can be risky, we need to be sure that making healthy choices isn’t life threatening.What does this mean for Ward 11?More livable, safer streets: Everyone should be safe and secure no matter how they get around, be it walking, driving, cycling or taking transit.We need to keep working on making this a city for everyone - not just the young, healthy and wealthy. Development is coming to Ward 11 and it needs to be sensitive with appropriate conversations of what’s to come.Better communication, better listening: We’ve been shut out of too much of what’s happening at City Hall. I’ll work at ensuring you have a conduit for what’s going on and I’ll be your voice to have your opinion heard.GET OUT TO VOTE!"

Ward 12,Brad Cunningham,challenger,Brad Cunningham - Ward 12,"Councillor PayLike any employment, City Hall wages should be tied to success. You should not have to keep footing a higher tax bill to reward your councillor for failure.I will support and comply with an independent review board to determine City Hall payAutomatic pay raises should be eliminated and replaced with an annual review by an independent panel, and vote.If it returns to an annual vote, I will vote NO in any year there is an unbalanced budget, or any increase to your taxes.Property TaxesYour hard-earned money should not be treated as a slush fund for continuous mismanagement of tax dollars.I will vote No to any increase to your property taxes as simply a means to increase revenueI will research and investigate alternative ways to more efficiently use your tax dollars within the current budget.ChildrenChildren are our future, we should be supporting and encouraging them at all levels instead of trying to benefit from them.I believe students should not have to pay to take public transit during school hours to and from school.I will work to make sports and activities more accessible and affordable for all families.AccountabilityYour council representative is there to speak for you. It needs to return to a system of Servant Leadership.The Ward website will be continuously maintained as a pipeline for your feedbackYour input will be requested, collected and respected towards key decisions and votesI will truly be YOUR voice in council.Other Key points:I will push to make it Law that any decision made by plebiscite, can not be overturned by council except by plebiscite. Your democratic rights were taken away by council when , after twice being voted in by the voters, Fluoride was removed by Council in 2011 without any respect to the people they represent. Furthermore, a vote was taken first to return it to plebiscite  and that motion was defeated 8-5I will work with you, and the Calgary Flames towards a world class facility that benefits the city and its residents , with your input guiding the way"
Ward 12,Shane Keating,incumbent,Shane Keating - Ward 12,"Your community matters. If we want to build a Calgary that is for everyone, that means making investments in the quadrants of the city that need them the most. Southeast Calgary is the fastest growing area in the city and we need investments to match that growth.My commitment to improve Ward 12 is to secure funding for the infrastructure investments our communities need and continue to offer residents the best possible value for their tax dollars. I hope to accomplish this by:-          Identifying strategic ways to engage with Calgarians to increase citizen involvement in local government.-          Striving to build consensus on Council to make meaningful progress on the things that matter to Calgarians.-          Bringing much needed recreational infrastructure to southeast Calgary.-          Addressing growing transportation concerns facing Calgary’s fastest growing quadrant.-          Encouraging responsible development in southeast Calgary.During my election campaigns in 2010 and 2013 residents told me that they desperately needed to see a plan to bring the LRT to southeast Calgary. Over the last 7 years I have been a tireless advocate for the Green Line LRT, Calgary’s largest ever investment in rapid transit. During the 2013 campaign I pledged to secure funding and financing for the project. In the last four years alone I have played a key role in securing $4.65 billion in funding from three orders of government. These funds will allow for the construction of Stage 1 of the Green Line from 16th Ave N to 126th Ave SE. Construction will begin in 2019/2020 and Stage 1 will open for operation in 2026.But we aren't finished yet. Over the next four years I pledge to work with the project team to find efficiencies within the procurement process of Stage 1 to extend construction to the McKenzie Towne Station. I also pledge to work with my colleagues on Council to identify future stages of the Green Line LRT and secure funding from The City of Calgary, The Government of Alberta and The Government of Canada. Residents of southeast Calgary know that we have more work ahead of us, and I hope they believe in me to deliver the rest of this project.On October 16, 2017, I hope I can count on your vote to continue being your strong advocate for Ward 12."
Ward 12,Teresa Hargreaves,challenger,Teresa Hargreaves - Ward 12,"Hi, welcome to Ward 12.  I am Teresa Hargreaves.  I was born and raised in this dynamic city we all call home.  I have been a resident within Ward 12, for over 21 years and have experienced the explosion and growth within our unique footprint.With our ever changing boundaries, growth, development and expansion has led to many different requirements that need to be addressed.  Within my career I have developed excellent communication and organizational skills.  As an oil and gas Landman, I act as a liaison between oil and gas companies and landowners to negotiate and achieve practical solutions, resulting in land asset acquisition and management.   These abilities are a definite asset in accomplishing any concerns we may face.Issues I have discovered are currently, that we do not have a police department east of the river.  Due to the economy, crime has increased and has put additional strain on our system.  This is a vital part of our community safety.  A low cost solution is the utilization of existing facilities, to accommodate small detachments.The LRT greenline plans are already in place, so now we need to be proactive instead of reactive regarding potential problems this may bring.As part of my profession I am involved with orphan wells.  These are wells, and facilities, that no longer have a company operating them.  These wells impose a potential environmental risk, health and safety concerns.  One of the risks are pipelines that are no longer being operated and the Orphan Well Association does not have these lines scheduled for decommission, within their current mandate.  Considering some of these pose an environmental hazard our current safety plans may not include shelter in place, as evacuation may not be an option.  We need to start dialogues, education and training and work towards keeping our residents safe, with shelter in place programs.Within the City of Calgary and close proximity to rural areas our first responders will be our front line.  We need to ensure that proper emergency response mechanisms are part of the training and City procedures.As a business owner managing finances are part of my success. I would like to take these abilities to better manage City finances and budgeting, working for a better today and future for our citizens.I am a passionate hard working person who will definitely address matters, that may arise within our Ward and look for solutions to resolve them.It is time, we Ward 12, get heard and action to be taken. I feel it is critical to know what is on your mind.Please visit my website and take the on‐line survey. These questions are what constituents have already expressed.  Send me an email to address your concerns and they too will be added to the survey.  Utilizing these results to gather information, to narrow down top priorities, showing me what direction to take, once elected.Thank you in advance for your time and attention and I look forward to working with you."
Ward 13,Adam Boechler,challenger,Adam Boechler - Ward 13,"I get the sense that the world is facing significant challenges and that I am sitting on the sidelines.  Global warming, the economy, terrorism, our 2013 flood, the Fort McMurray fire, smoke from BC forest fires, the list goes on.  As a natural and trained leader, I will make a positive contribution to my community and the city I call home.I have concerns for the world my daughter and the next generation will inherit.  We must utilize technology, innovation and investment to build Calgary into a city of the future, one that serves as an example to municipalities the world over in pursuit of sustainability, cost efficiency and good governance.I have an extraordinarily optimistic view of the world, blessed with the opportunities that growing up in Calgary has enabled.  Humanity has shown me beauty that transcends religion, nationality or creed.  People are intrinsically good and we are all in this life together, I am an ally and friend to all communities.As the voice of Ward 13, I will represent our neighbours by:•	Partnership and relationship building – with citizens, fellow councillors, community centres, other municipalities and levels of government, the Tsuu T’ina and the media.•	Ensuring good governance and corporate fiscal responsibility.•	Support and advocate for our communities through Parks, Recreation and Transit facilities.Visit www.voteadamb.com for more details and other exciting ideas including challenges to fellow councillors.Given the current economic uncertainty it would be irresponsible to advocate for substantial changes, preferring instead for an evolution to current services rather than revolution.  I want to make small affordable tweaks that provide substantial value to the citizens of Ward 13 and Calgary.  We’re doing a great job already, but must remain diligent in consistently improving city services and infrastructure.The immediate future will place many challenges on Council, there are important decisions that will be made.  Decisions on a potential Olympic bid could mean infrastructure investments in a new arena, Ctrain expansion to the airport, and retrofitting to existing winter athletic facilities.  Marijuana legalization, the fentanyl crisis, secondary suites, and economic challenges will all also take analysis and decisive action.The role of municipal government is service provision and is more important to the daily lives of citizens than any other level of government.  When you call 911 help is sent, when you turn your taps water pours out, and when you need to relax we have world class parks and recreation facilities.  We have to be focused and determined to leave our city better today, to ensure a prosperous and healthy tomorrow for future generations.  Today I ask for your support in helping me make my mark on Calgary.   Please visit my website at www.voteadamb.com to learn more about me and for more details on my platform.  Reach out anytime."
Ward 13,Adam Frisch,challenger,Adam Frisch - Ward 13,"The Councillor’s role is: “To represent the electorate as well as the whole municipality; to gather information and access in light of what is the common good and to balance the wants of the individual constituents with the needs of the entire community.” (Excerpt Candidate Information Book pg. 63)I am here to listen and serve the constituents of Ward 13 and take into considerations the needs of the City.  My platform is, in part:Open Access to your CouncillorI will hold scheduled and regular conversations with the residents of Ward 13 every quarter (Jan, April, July and October) to listen to your concerns, ideas and feedback.   I will then work towards providing answers to you as quickly as possible.  You may not always get the answer you want, but you will be heard and you will get an answer.  Our Ward deserves and is entitled to have a City Councillor who will take your concerns seriously.Only having a 'report card' every four years near an election, as is the current case, doesn't serve the communities well and needs to change.Your Taxes and Tax RoomI am committed to keeping taxes to a minimum by looking at how we are currently utilizing the tax dollars you already give to the city.Budgets need to be reviewed to ensure the NEEDS of the various departments are met to provide the best possible service to everyone without unnecessary WANTS increasing the bottom line.  Have a regular review of current policies and streamlining them if they don’t make sense.The practice of Council and your current Councillor voting in favour of arbitrarily keeping Tax Room that the Province gives back to you equates to an automatic and permanent tax increase that you have no say in.  The Tax Room is money the Province doesn’t need and is intended to go back to YOU:  No debates, No Exceptions, GIVE IT BACK!The Secondary Suites issue must be dealt with once and for all.   With good business rules in place, most applications can be dealt with by City Administration.  Only the most exceptional cases should be brought forward for Council to consider.   All new communities should be developed in a way that would allow for legal secondary suites.Winter Olympic bid should not go ahead based on the current cost projections.   The amount of money earmarked for security is only about half of what it would actually cost and therefore the bid projection is not reliable.   More work would need to be done on the cost projection before I could see myself supporting it.For information on other issues visit my website:  www.adamwfrisch.info Campaign paid for entirely by Adam W Frisch"
Ward 13,Art Johnston,challenger,Art Johnston - Ward 13,"The current city council has lost touch with the Calgarians it serves, and it’s time for a change.We need to bring fresh ideas, a spirit of co-operation and a common sense approach back to city council.Lower taxesIt’s time to stop gouging Calgarians. Taxes are continually increasing at every level of government, and taxpayers aren’t seeing a return on their investment. It’s time for a common sense approach. We need to elect a city council in October that will cut wasteful spending and respect taxpayers’ hard-earned dollars.Kickstart the local economyCalgary has been hit hard in recent years. Too many Calgarians are out of work, and the current council has not made their lives easier. Red tape and bureaucracy has slowed recovery and gotten in the way of job creation at the  very worst time. I will champion measures to reduce the administrative burden and cut unnecessary regulations.Safe communitiesAs a former Calgary police officer, I know all too well the toll that crime can take on a community. I am particularly concerned with the ongoing fentanyl crisis in our city. I will support measures to get these drugs off of our streets and ensure first responders have the tools they need to protect the community and make it home safely to their families at the end of the day.Public artI believe public art is valuable to the community and should be encouraged. However, the current policy is clearly not working. Public art should be accessible to the community, not jammed into a corner of a highway interchange. Public art should also come at a reasonable cost to taxpayers, with more meaningful consultations with community members.Calgary Olympic BidThose of us who remember the 1988 Olympics know the community spirit and pride that Calgarians felt about hosting the Games in our own backyard. With council currently considering a bid for 2026, I believe Calgary could support a bid for the Games, in partnership with Edmonton, to keep costs down.Sports FacilitiesWhile I support the development of a new arena to meet the needs of Calgarians, the Flames organization will need to be creative in raising funds. I am supportive of their endeavours to do so, but not at the expense of taxpayers.TransparencyI believe elected officials should be accountable and transparent to the citizens they serve. It is unacceptable to me that Calgary’s city council leads the country in time spent “in-camera” and hidden away from public scrutiny. As councillor, I will support measures to limit in-camera sessions as much as possible.Term LimitsI don’t believe that Calgarians are well served by lifetime politicians who remain in their positions for decades at a time. City council needs fresh ideas and councillors who are engaged with their communities. I would commit to bringing forward a proposal to implement term limits if elected."
Ward 13,Diane Colley-Urquhart,incumbent,Diane Colley-Urquhart - Ward 13,"SOUND FISCAL MANAGEMENT OF YOUR TAX DOLLARS•	Cut property taxes by continuing to pressure the Province to not take 51% of your property taxes ($650M/yr). Return money directly back to you that the Province doesn’t take.•	Continue to reduce operating costs and increase efficiencies. Be a leader in keeping taxes low while delivering needed programs and services we are responsible for.  Partner with the private sector.•	Demonstrate accountability, transparency and tax value to citizens for the services delivered.•	My Motion to freeze Management salaries and bonuses was adopted by Council in 2016.  This needs to continue.•	My motion to bring in a Sunshine List for full disclosure of City staff salaries, benefits and perks was adopted by Council. More transparency and detail is needed.•	Don’t support the proposed City Charter that would allow the City to run annual operating deficits.•	Freeze the Public Art Program and have the private sector pay (not taxpayers) as part of being awarded infrastructure projects.NEIGHBOURHOOD SAFETY &amp; SECURITY•	With speeding, social disorder and theft as the main issues for residents in Ward 13, we must continue to increase the number of frontline Police Officers to strengthen community-based policing. Add more Transit Police to the LRT system.•	Hold property owners accountable for their derelict problem properties that degrade a neighbourhood.  Bring owners before the Coordinated Safety Response Team (CSRT) to address citizen concerns in a timely manner.  Have City staff use approved tools like remedial orders, violation tickets and court injunctions for compliance.ROADS, TRANSIT &amp; MANAGING CONGESTION•	As in other cities, pilot a new “Safety School Zone Plan” through the Innovation Fund that would include engaging with families to identify “watch your speed” driver feedback signs, flashing beacons on school zone signs, and more school zone stencils on pavement which would extend up to 250 metres away from the designated schools to encourage children to walk or bike and feel safe.•	STOP the SWBRT expansion going past Rockyview Hospital with a newly elected Council.  The need for this Bus Rapid Transit is not justified to go into Woodbine.  Wait until the new community of Providence is built out over the next 10 years.COMMUNITY QUALITY OF LIFE•	Increase the number of soccer, hockey, tennis courts, baseball fields, skateboard parks and tot lots, along with more community programming.•	With 150 off-leash dog parks in Calgary, we need more in Ward 13. Finalize the addition of three new off-leash dog parks in Providence, along the 37th Street SW Corridor, and at the former park north of the community of Silverado.•	Eliminate dandelions in public areas by increasing weed control and mowing practices.•	Launch Citizen Juries to genuinely engage residents on any topic, issue or policy (unlike the SWBRT process and using 4-minute opinion phone polls)."
Ward 13,Mark Dyrholm,challenger,Mark Dyrholm - Ward 13,"My policies will be practical, aimed at keeping Calgary City Council vibrant, accountable, fiscally responsible, and renewable, taking down barriers to make access to City of Calgary services an easier and less cumbersome process.ZERO BASED BUDGETING – Recently, businesses and families have had to become more efficient, making decisions with fewer resources.•	Zero-based budgeting will bring efficiency to City Hall. Departments MUST look at what is needed to provide services to prevent bureaucratic growth.•	Front line service providers are not the enemy. They have even been discouraged by their managers for their suggestions on improving the services they deliver. I have experienced first-hand, city employees telling me personally that they are routinely ignored by managers when suggesting improvements.•	Citizens of Calgary let’s take pride in being known as the most dynamic and efficient city in Canada.•	Every organization gets more of what it rewards.  Let's reward and require a process of constant improvement.  Zero-based budgeting is just one tool I will use to move this forward.TERM LIMITS – I believe that council chambers must be kept vibrant and open-minded with a constant flow of new ideas for council members to give scrutiny to. Council members should have a “best before date”. Council is a living organism and must be fed accordingly. Keeping this in mind, I propose that once elected to be a member of Calgary City Council, incumbents should be limited to three terms thereby regularly refreshing City Hall.POLICY CONVENTION 2018 - A public policy process is the lifeblood of a respectful political system.•	Political policy is better when done in the light of day.•	I am committing to having a public policy process for Ward 13 in the First and Third years of my term.TRANSPARENCY – Contracts to provide services to the City of Calgary must be free of favouritism, bias, and interference.•	Tendering and Bidding on all major contracts, those over $25,000.00 would be city policy. These contracts will be made public.•	Preference to Local Businesses – Where bids are close to equivalent, contracts will be awarded to local contractors.•	City Council Represents Calgarians – Private meetings of City Council must be minimized.REVIEW OF MUNICIPAL OPERATIONS – Calgary needs to operate efficiently, projects be completed on time and on budget, unnecessary projects eliminated, capital expenditures brought under control, and waste of taxpayer’s money must be curtailed.ELIMINATE BUREAUCRATIC RED TAPE – Currently it can take 11 months or more for construction and other private sector projects to be approved. New businesses are waiting months to open their doors, creating new jobs, because permits to operate take forever to be issued. This is counterproductive to growth and economic success. It must be stopped."
Ward 13,Sherrisa Celis,challenger,Sherrisa Celis - Ward 13,"TAXATIONIf you own a home or business in Calgary you’ve noticed the city has been on a rollercoaster of unpredictable tax changes for the last few years. City council has approved near annual tax increases, which have been particularly troubling for local businesses trying to make ends meet, which have left Calgarians feeling the pinch. We’ve all had to wait until 2017 to enjoy tax stability due to a large depletion of our reserve fund. The City of Calgary must realize that during a recession, Calgarians do not have the ability to pay for annual tax increases. Large increases for businesses operating in the suburbs are forcing some over the edge. I’ll work for tax stability at City Hall to get us off the cycle of annual increases which are unsustainable by focusing spending on high quality essential services. The City needs to budget and spend carefully and avoid niche projects and interests which it cannot afford.TRANSPORTATIONThe daily commute is a reality for most residents of Ward 13. The City of Calgary needs to ensure adequate planning for our future transportation needs by improving public transportation and road planning. Our communities can be made more walkable and safe through a more proactive assessment of the needs of the community and the increased use of cross walks and lights. We also need to keep Calgary moving through an improved snow removal plan in the winter months.CONSULTATIONResidents deserve to be consulted in a meaningful way about developments that will impact their community. The City of Calgary must take public input into consideration before a project is approved, not afterwards. Community support should be a key element for a project to move forward and opposition must be reflected in future decisions. We also need a member of council who’s meeting with the community on a regular basis.FAIR ENTRYWe need to ensure that the Fair Entry program continues so that everyone can participate fully in the life of the City. Currently, some of our seniors are being left out by the way their income is calculated. The Fair Entry program must assess an individual’s income in the case of seniors.COMMUNITY CENTRESFar too many communities in Ward 13 do not have a community centre and nothing has been done to remedy the situation in the last 17 years. Community centres serve as important hubs for clubs, children, seniors and adults to gather for active living and public engagement. We need a member of council who will work with the City of Calgary and business to build community centres in Ward 13.I believe in the value of volunteerism and in engaging all of our citizens in the life of the City of Calgary. I’m running to be your proactive and accessible Councillor for Ward 13. Let’s make sure we all have a voice at City Hall."
Ward 14,Peter Demong,incumbent,Peter Demong - Ward 14,"Calgary is a fantastic place to live, and Ward 14 is the envy of the entire city. If elected, my goal will be to make sure it stays that way by keeping City Hall out of your wallet, and making sure the money it does take goes to benefit Ward 14. I will remember my small business roots, and the pain of sending my hard earned money to the government. I will never forget that you‐‐the taxpayer‐‐are my boss.I will continue to search for every efficiency, and cost‐cutting measure within the City’s budget, and I will not support any budget that does not strive for savings. Zero‐based reviews and the “Cut the Red Tape” Committee‐‐both of which I have been heavily involved in‐‐have each already saved tens of millions, and my budget savings account has saved over $100 million, and counting. Public art is a want, not a need which is why I proposed to cut it. There are many ways that I have saved money, but there are many more that we need to find. I urge you to visit www.peterdemong.ca your‐money for examples of how I am looking out for your wallet.I will continue to remember where I came from, and who I work for. I have always used my monthly Counciltalk meetings, and my annual BBQ as ways to keep in touch with the people in Ward 14. I try to poll my constituents whenever possible, and make a point to knock on doors regularly. I will never stop seeking out the out the opinions of my constituents, and I will never hide behind the walls of City Hall. I urge you to visit www.peterdemong.ca/your‐community, and www.peterdemong.ca/your‐voice for examples of how I am making Ward 14, and its people, my top priority.When I was first elected in 2010 I ran as a business owner fed up with City Hall, its endless tax increases, and lack of accountability. Since then I have made it my mission to remain true to those roots. If elected, I will continue to do exactly that! I am the employee, you are my employer, and you know best how to spend your own money."
